# HEXACO PERSONALITY TRAITS
# The HEXACO has 6 axis, for now we can have 3 values for each axis... mininum, maximum, neutral.
# The Axis are:
# Honesty-Humility: mininum means a person is deceitful AND combative and unhelpful, maximum means person is honest but also altruistic and might avoid conflicts.
# Emotionality: called "neuroticism" on big-5 model, it is basically how paranoid a person is about negative outcomes, but it also generate other emotions, a person with high emotionality will be prone to depression and paranoia, while a person with low emotionality will be rational and logical, but might show some problems in detecting danger.
# Extraversion and Introversion is about how much a person likes to interact with other people, it IS possible to be introverted and gregarious, and extraverted and shy, it is not about social competence, but about how much the person enjoys interacting.
# Agreeableness is measures dominance, "jerkyness", patience, flexibility, a max agreeable person will do whatever other people want, while a max disagreeable person might be an extreme jerk but also will be very, very good at pursuing his goals. As an RL example, debt collectors tend to be people that are disagreeable, not because they are jerks, but because debtors won't be able to bend them.
# Conscientiousness is related to diligence, perfectionism, organization, and pro-activity, in RL research is axis that most easily predict life outcomes, high Conscientiousness people tend to be successful, while low Conscientiousness end in prison at an alarming rate.
# Openness to experience is how much curious a person are, and how intellectually driven they are, a very open person will be prone to do extreme things, like joining extreme sports and being avant-garde artist, while a very closed person will be flat and boring in interests.
