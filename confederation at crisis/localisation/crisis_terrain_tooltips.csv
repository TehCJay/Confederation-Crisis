#Star Type Names and Descriptions
neutron_star;Neutron Star;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neutron_star_desc;These stars are compact masses of neutrons, they are usually only slightly heavier than Earth's sun, but their diameter is the size of a neighbourhood, about 20km.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
main_sequence;Main Sequence;Séquence principale;Hauptreihe;;Secuencia principal;;;;;;;;;x
main_sequence_desc;These stars are the most popular choice for colonization, the sun is one of them thus they tend to offer similar environments, also they tend to be quite boring, in the sense no surprises are expected from them, and no surprises is a good thing in space.;Séquence principale;Hauptreihe;;Secuencia principal;;;;;;;;;x
white_dwarf;White Dwarf;Naine blanche;Weißer Zwerg;;Enana blanca;;;;;;;;;x
white_dwarf_desc;These tiny stars are what happens to a main sequence star after it runs out of fuel, they actually don't shine either, they are just so hot that they glow like any other very hot material, but all this hotness is result from what they were before, even having masses similar to the Sun, they are planet-sized, and will eventually cool off completely and become a black rock of sorts, but this will take longer than the age of the universe to happen.;Naine blanche;Weißer Zwerg;;Enana blanca;;;;;;;;;x
red_giant;Red Giant;Géante rouge;Rotor Riese;;Gigante roja;;;;;;;;;x
red_giant_desc;Red Giants are main sequence stars that ran out of hydrogen for their fusion and now are fusing helium instead, this greatly expands their size, but cool them down, but as long colonies aren't close enough to crash on it, living near them is similar to living near our sun, even if some distance is needed because of the star great size.;Géante rouge;Rotor Riese;;Gigante roja;;;;;;;;;x
debris_disk;Debris Disk;Disque de débris;Trümmerscheibe;;Disco de escombros;;;;;;;;;x
debris_disk_desc;These are faint discs of dust around a star, either because planets will form, or because whatever was there is now destroyed for some reason. Although the debris is often fairly visible from long distances, near disk itself it is not so obvious, being just some kind of background dust with the occasional rock here and there, it is not hard to colonize in such places, and the dust provides some small defense since it interferes with lasers.;Disque de débris;Trümmerscheibe;;Disco de escombros;;;;;;;;;x
pulsar;Pulsar;Pulsar;Pulsar;;Púlsar;;;;;;;;;x
pulsar_desc;The name of this type of star is related to the fact they are seemly emitting pulsed signals in regular intervals, the source of these signals is actually their poles that emit enormous amounts of gamma radiation, they are for all intents and purposes extra-dangerous neutron stars, since they are actual neutron stars but spinning so fast that it starts to spew radiation everywhere like a lighthouse. Navigating near one is dangerous, not just because the gravity but because of the need to avoid getting hit.;Pulsar;Pulsar;;Púlsar;;;;;;;;;x
black_hole;Black Hole;Trou noir;Schwarzes Loch;;Agujero negro;;;;;;;;;x
black_hole_desc;Black holes are stars that had so much gravity, that when they ran out of fuel there was nothing to hold them back from collapsing under their own gravity, the result is a extremely compact region of space, with all the mass and gravity of a star, but a tiny size and no light being emitted. Navigating around them is dangerous since it is easy to 'crash' on them, rather fall on them, a fall that there is no reversing, being stranded without engines in such star system means certain death.;Trou noir;Schwarzes Loch;;Agujero negro;;;;;;;;;x
nebula;Nebula;Nébuleuse;Nebel;;Nebulosa;;;;;;;;;x
nebula_desc;The word Nebula, refers to many different things in space, the only thing common between all of them is that they appearance is nebulous. At Star System scales the kind of Nebula that matters are the Planetary Nebula, that are actually misnamed, since they are in fact more of a Red Giant nebula, these nebulas are result of a red giant shedding its outer layers and filling the area with gas. The other kind of Nebula that matters for navigation are the gigantic remnants of Super Nova, these can easily fill a huge area that encompass several hundred if not more, star systems, Veil Nebula is one of these. Finally another important kind, that sometimes overlaps with the first two, are regions that are rich with material for the formation of new stars and planets, Orion nebula is one of these. To the disappointment of people that think that Nebulas are beautiful and must look awesome when we are travelling inside them, they are quite boring when seen from inside, although they do have more gas than most of the empty space between stars, they are still even more empty than any machine-produced vacuum possible on Earth.;Nébuleuse;Nebel;;Nebulosa;;;;;;;;;x
protostar;Protostar;Proto-étoile;Protostern;;Protoestrella;;;;;;;;;x
protostar_desc;In areas with Nebulas, new stars start forming, these are called Protostars, extremely new ones are completely useless for humanity, being just a slightly denser than normal gas that is hard to even find, but those that are about to become Main Sequence stars are more interesting, they emit infra-red light instead of normal colors, making them a source of heat but not a source of visible light, and although most of them have only gas around them, some might have rocks here and there nearby, if the rocks are big enough to star becoming planets, they probably will be overheated with exposed mantles, being good, if dangerous, places to find some materials, or for some kind of disaster tourism.;Proto-étoile;Protostern;;Protoestrella;;;;;;;;;x
sparse_system;Sparse System;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sparse_system_desc;This is not a type of star, it is a type of colonization, a Sparse System is one where for whatever reasons the jumpgates weren't built in a more reasonable distance, also these systems are usually very empty, fighting inside them is dangerous because there is no defense, it is like a cannon fight in a flat boxing ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
goldilocks_star;Goldilocks Star System;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
goldilocks_star_desc;This is not a type of star, but is the description that people came up with to explain how things work near the most popular Main Sequence stars, these stars are all similar to the Sun (including the Sun itself obviously), have wide Goldilocks Zone (the region where planets and bigger moons can be easily terraformed, including Earth itself), the gates are all near something useful, and there is plenty of traffic. Because of these features these systems are very useful, but dangerous, fighting in them means risking getting ambushed, with whoever was already in the system having the chance to build minefields near gates or putting mass drivers in asteroids pointing at those gates, crime is also more common due to the economic wealth available.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
supergiant;Supergiant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
supergiant_desc;These stars are absolutely massive, dangerous, hot and bright, completely unrelated to normal red giants, they are stars that from the start were gigantic, Betelgeuse for example is twenty times heavier than the Sun, and literally a thousand times larger. These stars produce ridiculous amounts of stellar wind, so much that the wind blows away planets, not just near them but near other stars too, there is no dust near them, only hellish superheated gases. Although it is extremely bad idea to ever try to live near one, Astrists in particular mastered the techniques to figure out where the winds will NOT be, and plan accordingly when building self-propelled space stations, this knowledge was used during the colonization of Orion to build the gates there intentionally in a way that to reach the heart of the region, it is necessary to cross military Astrist bases near supergiants, perfect places for mounting defenses, since any invader would have to take a predictable path avoiding the ridiculously powerful stellar winds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
