tp_security_q_3_desc;Retired veterans, washouts and cripples are a good source of knowledge for our reserve. While in most cases they lack the ability to materially contribute, their knowledge and experience helps deal with the growing pains of an expanding command and makes it possible for our pilots to be more than cannon fodder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_4;Security;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_4_desc;The facilities increase in size lets us maintain more models and we are now deploying a few top of the line versions scattered among the rest. By themselves they are not enough to change battles, but the uncertainty they generate is an effective force multiplier forcing the enemy to turn away from what could be potentially superior enemy and spend more ammunition to insure they achieve a kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_5;Security;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_5_desc;The reserve is large enough that it can maintain more specialized equipment- high quality sensors, different munition choices, flight configurations, etc. Being able to have better gear as well as more options lets us punch on a more equal level and the ability to do customization at last provides a niche the reserves are better at than the regulars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_archive_q_5_desc;We've secured our storage facilities, but there isn't to much of a point to them if people can't use them. Not just the research staff, but local worlds now have access to many of the records and can now browse the stacks and examine the physical copies.

tp_administrative_sector_q_2;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_2_desc;One of the easiest methods to improve governance- or at least its appearance- is to promote feedback and respond to it. Finding the most common lines of questioning and setting up an automated system to answer them lets citizens have a feeling of being more involved without diverting manpower from the research staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_3;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_3_desc;Sometimes the questions we receive are actually novel.

tp_classrooms_q_1;Classrooms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_1_desc;One of the best ways for a scientific settlement to gain additional funds is to offer private education for upper class members of society and train the local residents.  The infrastructure needed to offer this service are classrooms, lecture halls, and student labs.  There is a big upfront investment, but they'll pay for themselves in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_2;Classrooms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_2_desc;One of the unpleasant realities of interstellar colonization is that different worlds have different days, different color skies, different smells, different everything. Instead of just sticking to galactic standard, we can make our learning facilities morphic and have them match the students native environment. Aside from being more comfortable, it makes learning occur faster and allows us to process applicants faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_3;Classrooms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_3_desc;Improving the rate that people learn is an important benefit that social psychology has delivered us and we finally have the clout and resources to put their findings in place. While some of them differ significantly from what is expected, no one can deny the improvements in education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_4;Classrooms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_4_desc;One of the reasons people come to these facilities is to meet important scientists and feel that they have a hang on the current state of fields they are interested in. To that end we've made it so they have substantially more time to interact with the facilities staff and see them at work. To compensate for this and to avoid work grinding to a halt we've been forced to implement a significant number of improvements to the intern system. Having the students take some of the drudge work load by making it easy to learn the requirements alleviates the total loss of productivity we'd otherwise face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_5;Classrooms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_5_desc;Learning generally degrades over time as the memories weaken. While there are techniques to try to insure the created memories are stronger, we can also create more robust alumni outreach. Offering further training and keeping our graduates knowledge up to date, we raise our status and the premium we can command for schooling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_6;Classrooms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_6_desc;Standing out from the pack is always hard, so we've been forced to do something truly unique.

tp_exotic_research_q_1;Exotic Materials Research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_1_desc;As humans explore more and more of the galaxy, new and exciting compounds are also being discovered.  One of the most exciting (and explosive) of the emerging fields is working on new exotic materials.  Large bombing ranges and delivery ships are of course necessary to test the new materials that can then be sold for mining and property development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_2;Exotic Materials Research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_exotic_research_q_5_desc;Sometimes sheer firepower isn't enough and in those cases you need something else. Something like miniature black holes. The amount of resources needed to create, control and study just a single event are staggering, but the payoff make it profitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_super_computer_q_1_desc;Humans are by their very nature as a naturally evolved species, inefficient.  Turning over control of much of the low level functions of society to computers both greatly increases efficiency and speeds the transfer of knowledge by freeing up people's time to spend on recreation and improving their knowledge.  During wartime, supercomputers can be repurposed to supply combat drones with much greater battlefield awareness and improved tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_super_computer_q_2_desc;There are a vast amount of small electronic devices with computing power that spend most of it idle. We've integrated them with the supercomputer allowing subsidiary programs to be offloaded and boosting the amount of processing power we can eek out from the mainframe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_super_computer_q_3_desc;Heating issues puts a limit to the size we can normally expand the supercomputer servers, but with a new coolant system allows us to upscale the current model. Incredibly energy intensive because it both siphons off phenomenal amounts of heat and insures the temperate of the servers stays constant, the cost is justified by the increase in capability and efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_super_computer_q_4_desc;Specialized physical hardware is more efficient for specific tasks then the generic servers so we've for new servers to be designed for a specific task by the supercomputer, fabricated on site and slotted in. Processing power is improved and the computing hub is now a constant whirlwind of activity. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
