levy_tax_decision;Call for a Levy Tax;;;;;;;;;;;;x
levy_tax_decision_desc;While no formal system of taxation truly exists in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], the reigning [Root.GetTitle] is permitted to levy the wealth of [Root.GetHersHis] vassals once every year. However, it is ultimately up to each vassal whether or not to honor the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
english_classics_decision;Study the English Classics;;;;;;;;;;;;x
english_classics_decision_desc;Take some time to peruse the Royal Archive of Avalon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL0;You are preparing to request funds from the many subjects of your realm. You can only do this once per year.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL1;TO: [Root.GetTitledName]\nFROM: [From.GetTitledName]\nRE: A Levy Tax\nWe, in accordance with established law and oath in our fair realm of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], request a contribution to the treasury for the next year.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCNEOFEUDAL1;Send 30% of our annual income.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDNEOFEUDAL1;Politely decline our sovereign's request.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL5;Your deeds in the latest engagement have not gone unnoticed. With the recommendation of your squadron and immediate superiors, [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] Majesty has bestowed you with a 'life knighthood'. While not hereditary as in the case of a landed title of nobility, holders of life knighthoods are considered equal in prestige and, among certain circles, arguably superior to their unblooded peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL5_ALT;Your deeds in the latest engagement have won acclaim from the lords, knights, and men-at-arms of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] fleet, with those assembled proclaiming you Knight-[Root.GetTitle]. It seems the concept of the warrior-sovereign is not so archaic as once thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANEOFEUDAL5;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL6;With each martial exploit, the star of your fame climbs higher and higher. This reputation is not limited to just the home stars, with enemy captains and pilots across known space either dreading your presence or relishing a chance to put your reputation to the test. Perhaps in time, you will be counted among the greatest knights in human history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANEOFEUDAL6;Perhaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL7;The foes of the realm tremble at the mere possibility of your presence in battle, and your life has become the stuff of songs and poetry. Every return home is greeted with a parade, and you have won more medals than you know what to do with. Some even compare you to the most noble of Terra's ancient heroes: the Nine Worthies. Few, alive or dead, could even think of claiming this honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANEOFEUDAL7;Truly, I am without equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBNEOFEUDAL7;I have fulfilled my duties, and nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL9;The Kingdom of Avalon is young, but its heritage is ancient and great. So as to maintain this cultural continuity, efforts have been made to collect the great works of the old English in the Royal Archives. I should delve into this collection, that I may learn from those who came before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANEOFEUDAL9;The Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies of the Bard sound most fascinating.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDNEOFEUDAL9;I would like to know more of ancient monarchs and how they ruled.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL10;I did what I could, but my attempts to study the work of the ancients has not proven fruitful. The material is there and time is available, I simply lack the enthusiasm to continue. What little I did manage to engage with in these past months has not taught me much, if at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANEOFEUDAL10;What a pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL11;In these past months I have immersed myself in the collected works of William Shakespeare, also known as the Bard of Avon. It has been an enlightening learning experience, and your newfound grasp of poetry has proven a hit with the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANEOFEUDAL11;My studies have paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL12;In these past months I have immersed myself in the compiled Legendarium, the national epic of the ancient English. Reading the accounts of the First Age and of the Noldor in particular has been an enthralling experience for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNEOFEUDAL13;In these past months I have immersed myself in the oldest work of English literature, recounting the life of the great Hero-King Beowulf.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
