ct_primary_q_0;Outpost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_0_desc;This world holds only a single, small settlement, barely worthy of the title. There are no permanent inhabitants here - it is inhabited only by a crew of a few hundred at most, assigned here as part of their duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_1;Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_1_desc;This world is inhabited, but only just. There may be anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand people on the world, and at least a few of them have decided to make their homes here permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_2;Inhabited World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_2_desc;This world has a significant permanent population, measuring in the hundreds of thousands. Most of the population live in rural farming communities, with the only real city being the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_3;Urbanized World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_3_desc;This world has a large permanent population, numbering in the millions. While a narrow majority of the population still live in rural farming communities, there are also many major cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_4;Conurbanized World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_4_desc;This world has a huge permanent population, numbering in the billions. The majority of the population live in cities, and the largest such have spread out to the point where it often difficult to tell where one city ends and the next begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_5;Ecumenopolis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_primary_q_5_desc;This world supports an unthinkably vast population, numbering in the trillions. With the exception of designated agricultural areas, the entire world has effectively become consumed by ubanization and transformed into a single contiguous city-scape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_1;Police Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_1_desc;A network of law enforcement infrastructure to help both with dealing with the worst parts of society and as a second line of defense against outside threats should the military fleets be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_2;Police Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_2_desc;Normal police organization is set up to be most effective at dealing with crime, but we have now developed a parallel military structure that police patrols can snap into. While nowhere as effective as a dedicated military organization it provides an improvement on the police's wartime capability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_3;Police Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_3_desc;Police, like most second line forces, tend to operate on hand me downs- craft that is obsolete, has limited capabilities or a few years from the scrapyard. Upgrading them to more modern capabilities insures that they can now go toe to toe with military craft which is an important consideration when dealing with pirates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_4;Police Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_4_desc;Coordinating training with the military and local reservists boosts the skill level of police, increasing their survivability in combat and ability to catch criminals who attempt evasive maneuvers learnt from military training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_5;Police Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_police_patrols_q_5_desc;One of the largest differences between civilians and the military the sheer amount of repair capacity the latter keeps in the reserve. While it is impractical to have this adopted for the police, some of the basic methods reduce the time spent in the repair bay and increase the number of effective patrol craft the police have on hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_1;Bomb Shelters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_1_desc;Underground or highly fortified bunkers for citizens to hide in during enemy assaults and to keep emergency provisions in.  These help delay capture from enemies and make direct assaults much more costly to undertake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_2;Bomb Shelters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_2_desc;Reaching a shelter is often an issue for citizens so mass transit has been beefed up with emergency vehicles to allow evacuation without compromising military measures. Shelters have also been reinforced to deal with the stress caused by the new openings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_3;Bomb Shelters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_3_desc;The most terrifying eventuality for a person trapped in a shelter is a direct hit or being buried alive. We've built short range intercepting lasers to make direct hits glancing hits and provided mobile earth movers for most of the primary shelters, allowing them to dig themselves out in a worst case scenario.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_4;Bomb Shelters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_4_desc;It is a constant race between more powerful weapons and defenses and in order to keep the population from becoming collateral damage we have been forced to dig deeper into the crust. At this depth the shockwaves produced by impacts are the main threat and the bunkers have been redesigned to deal with that and the increased weight of the rock overhead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_5;Bomb Shelters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bomb_shelters_q_5_desc;Improved shock absorption have allowed us to connect underground shelters and with this increased size we can have emergency receivers constantly stationed to make sudden evacuations smoother and pool repair machinery and living space so a compromised bunker does not result in the deaths of its occupants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_1;Recruitment Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_1_desc;A network of military buildings and facilities for training new ground forces and troop ships.  Allows for speedier recovery of garrison losses and a place to quickly modify freighters into transport ships that enable direct assaults on enemy planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_2;Recruitment Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_2_desc;Manpower demands of the fleet are voracious; to keep the war machine running we need to make the recruiting apparatus more deeply embedded in society. Linking up with youth groups, clubs and other organizations lets us spread the necessary attitudes and skills and insure we can fill out the existing fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_3;Recruitment Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_3_desc;Many issues with recruitment stem from groups of people who feel that military service is different; that it is low status, that it is unusual, that it is something that just isn't done. Having training near urban centers and generating constant interaction with locals helps break down those perceptions and shape culture to be more receptive to continual high volume recruitment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_4;Recruitment Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_4_desc;The draft marks the transition to adulthood. Just like adulthood, it is not voluntary. We've expanded the volume that the recruitment and training facilities can hold allowing them to manage the massive surge that accompanies calling up the draftees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_5;Recruitment Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_5_desc;Putting the draft in place starts a complex series of bureaucratic maneuvers, movement of people and reallocation of equipment. By providing more resources to our facilities we can allow them to practice without disrupting day to day operations and insure that when we need it the whole process will run smoothly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_6;Recruitment Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_recruitment_center_q_6_desc;Scraping the barrel used to be accomplished by lowering the standards but we can achieve it by more dedication to medical incentives. Spending amounts that would be unimaginable for most people in civilian contexts we can insure volunteers stay longer, have more experienced and fit individuals filling out the ranks and get plenty of new blood to replace losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_1;Garrison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_1_desc;All settlements need to be ready to defend themselves against enemy attacks, especially when space pirates could spring from tunneller wakes at any time.  The Garrison exists to defend economic settlements from this exact kind of sudden sneak attack, maintaining a number of frigates to be launched at any time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_2;Garrison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_2_desc;Expanding the home guard lets us crew more defense vessels. By simplifying many of the job requirements for the support staff, we can use these part time soldiers to free up more professionals to crew ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_3;Garrison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_3_desc;Retired veterans, washouts and cripples are a good source of knowledge for our reserve. While in most cases they lack the ability to materially contribute, their knowledge and experience helps deal with the growing pains of an expanding command and makes it possible for our pilots to be more than cannon fodder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_4;Garrison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_4_desc;The facility's increase in size lets us maintain more models and we are now deploying a few top of the line versions scattered among the rest. By themselves they are not enough to change battles, but the uncertainty they generate is an effective force multiplier forcing the enemy to turn away from what could be potentially superior enemy and spend more ammunition to insure they achieve a kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_5;Garrison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_emergency_reserve_q_5_desc;The reserve is large enough that it can maintain more specialized equipment, high quality sensors, different munition choices, flight configurations, etc. Being able to have better gear as well as more options lets us punch on a more equal level and the ability to do customization at last provides a niche the reserves are better at than the regulars. Also this facility can support a single battleship parked in a purpusefully-built drydock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_1;Mining Infrastructure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_1_desc;These are government-built facilities to provide infrastructure for mining business, both private and government owned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_2;Mining Infrastructure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_2_desc;These are government-built facilities to provide infrastructure for mining business, both private and government owned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_3;Mining Infrastructure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_3_desc;These are government-built facilities to provide infrastructure for mining business, both private and government owned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_4;Mining Infrastructure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_4_desc;These are government-built facilities to provide infrastructure for mining business, both private and government owned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_5;Mining Infrastructure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mining_infrastructure_q_5_desc;These are government-built facilities to provide infrastructure for mining business, both private and government owned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_1;Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_1_desc;A system of automatic manufacturing facilities used to increase the manufactured goods production of the entire settlement.  These robotic industry facilities are a good way to directly improve the income of a colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_2;Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_2_desc;The size of the factories and their expansion means that it is now efficient to build specific factories building the machines that build new factories. Now the main bottleneck is insuring the constant flow of raw materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_3;Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_3_desc;We've connected the factories demands to the mining, agricultural and other resource extractions fields. The ability to immediately request new materials helps keeps the factories going and insures sudden changes in demand or new techniques transmit through the system immediately instead of in staggered layers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_4;Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_4_desc;Generic factories are not the most efficient robotic facilities, but having them on standby allows us to replace the normal plants if an accident, explosion or other error takes out one of the regulars. We can speed up the tempo of the work as well as not have to worry about the supply line suddenly backing up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_5;Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_5_desc;Pollution and waste heat are unfortunate facts of life, but now they are being used as inputs for other industrial processes. Essential fields can expand without having to worry about the loss of efficiency or atmosphere becoming a toxic stew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_6;Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_6_desc;We've been forced to become a bit recursive with our latest attempt to eak out that little bit of efficiency. There are factories dedicated to making the tools to build the factories dedicated to refitting existing factories. While the setup has lead to a spate of jokes about recursiveness, the practical result is that production lines can be dedicated to new products even faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_7;Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_7_desc;Given the area factories cover, issue of placement to optimize production are crucial. Restructuring their deployment and providing facilities the ability to easily relocate means we can deal with what otherwise would be ever increasing diseconomies of scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_8;Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_factories_q_8_desc;Finally we've gotten to the point where the problem is not dealing with factories, but their connection with the rest of the economy. Previous improvements to infrastructure and transportation are no longer sufficient- the entire system has to be overhauled to keep up with the speed and volume of inputs and outputs. The result is productive capabilities which make most material issues trivial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_1;Trade Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_1_desc;Modern day terran space is very much uses the same highly interconnected system as the Earth since the sixteenth century.  Trade is incredibly important for every single human, allowing each and every system to produce goods in an optimal way.  Very large settlements naturally build huge trade centers to facilitate this.  They can feel like an entire city onto themselves of hotels, bazaars, warehouses, and shipping docks.  It is a common saying that there is always at least one person from every settlement in terran space in each trade center.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_2;Trade Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_2_desc;Expanding our volume of intergalactic trade involves orientating industry towards exports. Increasing the amount on the galactic market increases our visibility, leading to more demand and snowballing economic growth. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_3;Trade Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_3_desc;Once a significant volume of product is available the next step is selling the planets name and brand. Not just raising awareness of possible goods, this increases the premium our goods command instead of just producing generic products.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_4;Trade Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_4_desc;The next step is plugging in more companies to the standards of intergalactic trade. Providing the marketing tools to track galactic trends normally used by larger firms to start ups and other small sized companies gives more flexibility to meeting new crazes and other sudden booms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_5;Trade Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_center_q_5_desc We can only export things if people are providing things worth importing. The final step is to provide all these tools to other planets. Whether they are just starting or an established world the techniques we've refined let them produce valuable products, while earning us a commission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_1;Virtual Reality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_1_desc;Virtual reality holiday centers make great vacation options for people.  They're much cheaper than actually going on vacation, and much safer too.  The stress relief they offer helps people live happier more productive lives and give a great way to pull in some extra funds.  The fact that they also give a percentage of the regular population a not insignificant amount of combat training that they can apply to help defend the settlement is an added bonus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_2;Virtual Reality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_2_desc;More militarily relevant training has been placed in virtual reality games. The increased attention to detail we've provided has been used to boost the verisimilitude of a host of simulations and while the prospect of achievements and virtual currency is only a minor incentive, we've managed to increase familiarity with usable skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_3;Virtual Reality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_3_desc;Virtual exercise has been synched up with physical exertion letting people exercise in other worlds, fantasy locations and ancient Earth. The folding in of running, climbing and other physical groups boosts revenue while the increased level of fitness provides a boost to the level of recruits available for local defense. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_4;Virtual Reality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_4_desc;Simulations have been updated so that they can damped an individuals knowledge they are in a simulation. A boon for roleplayers, it also makes individuals more resistant to fear and familiar with highly tense, stressful and dangerous situations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_5;Virtual Reality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_virtual_reality_q_5_desc;Constantly updating the virtual reality database with current military hardware possessed by both us and our enemies not only insures that people are familiar with the latest tools of the trade, but that they are forced to think ahead- not just game the current system, but be prepared when the next innovation arrives. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_1;Public Schools;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_1_desc;Constant innovation is critical to human success and growing economies.  One of the best ways to maintain this is to have a highly educated population of potential innovators who can quickly adapt new developments to existing systems, as well as discover new applications of existing knowledge that no one had imagined was possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_2;Public Schools;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_2_desc;More funding means higher quality and this level of investment insures we are up to galactic standard. Further improvements in education are going to have to follow different approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_3;Public Schools;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_3_desc;There is a limit to how long we can keep people in the classroom so the next extension for learning is outside of it. We can insure the ideas and concepts they are learning are provided by the games, shows and other media they are exposed to. While it doesn't result in a tremendous difference, it provides a slight edge in learning and graduation, speeding up the rate new graduates inject new ideas into business, government and other organizations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_4;Public Schools;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_4_desc;Learning never truly ends and our network of museums seeks to insure it proceeds smoothly. Unlike traditional museums, these are layered so simpler ones lay the groundwork for the more complex ones, allowing individuals to gradually pick up the basics for entirely new fields. While not yet a substitute for schooling, it cuts down the time required for retraining significantly, as well as the turnover rate as individuals have a better idea of what their new vocation requires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_5;Public Schools;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_public_schools_q_5_desc;One of the most intractable barriers is the amount of time it takes to get an individual adjusted to a new job. We have managed to get firms to provide current and continuously updated version of the required skill sets and basic training, allowing training to go from the classroom directly to a job. The large reduction in time it takes for the company to get a new employee to become a useful asset has lead to a faster rate of pollination between firms and fields and a commensurate increase in the rate new techniques are implemented. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_1;Fine Arts Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_1_desc;Manual, service, and transport labor are things of the past.  Most practical jobs these days are engineering, management, or programming in nature.  Not everyone is suited to these kinds of jobs, but there are still other options to pursue to generate revenue and prestige for humanity.  Painters, writers, and musicians are all respected occupations that can positively thrive if given the right opportunity and each new world gives a new land, a new sky, and a new people to give inspiration. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_2;Fine Arts Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_2_desc;If you want art to be noticed, you need connections. Investment in the level of facilities the galaxies elite have grown accustomed to makes it more likely a big name promoter will come by and discover new talent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_3;Fine Arts Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_3_desc;Cycling in established artists is expensive, but it lets our talent see what is considered valuable as well as producing connections with people can help them get displayed latter on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_4;Fine Arts Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_4_desc;Like everything else this planet produces, there is an accepted taste or brand associated with it. With enough targeted marketing we can insure that this covers all the arts and completionists are interested in our output regardless of the quality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_5;Fine Arts Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_5_desc;Amateur artists are an untapped source of possible new ideas and by providing basic tools for people to make art in small slots of free time like on a commute or lunch break we can find new talent. Additionally it allows us to launch a new genre (although it is admittedly a thin and simplistic one).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_6;Fine Arts Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_6_desc;Setting lose artists on the community to make it more beautiful is supposed to "expose more individuals to the vibrancy of art and extend the field of creative expression". Its probable that they just wanted an excuse to paint the city, but it does benefit us by making society look less like every other planet as well as being of interest to tourists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_7;Fine Arts Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_7_desc;At this stage of the game, the competition is about getting the right people to live on our world. Their word is enough to make any single artist famous and bring in wealth and prestige to the educational system that spawned them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_8;Fine Arts Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_fine_arts_academy_q_8_desc;After all this time and effort we've finally gotten pieces that are good enough to grace your personal collection. Having something novel and beautiful is accessible to the masses and makes all the money we've spent on worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_forum_q_1;Trade Forum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_trade_forum_q_1_desc;A collection of offices that oversee the economic situation of human space as a whole.  They manage trade agreements, stock exchanges, and economic disputes.  This building does not provide planetary bonuses, instead unlocking special actions.\n\nSpecial actions unlocked:\n*Embargo Casus Belli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_government_citadel_q_1;Government Citadel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_government_citadel_q_1_desc;This massive citadel is the center of government for the entire republic.  Because of all the high ranking officials and the endless numbers of personal guards and corporate funding, this site is one of the most well defended economic settlements in all of human space.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_palace_of_justice_q_1;Palace of Justice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_palace_of_justice_q_1_desc;A courthouse designed to handle system wide disputes.  The presence of this building alone will help keep unrest from developing, while simultaneously speeding the rate at which it dissipates.  Having multiple palaces in the system can be very prestiges, but will not have any additional effect on unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_homeworld;Earth-That-Was;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_earth_that_was_desc;Earth was once the center of human civilization, the revered homeworld of the human race, but no more. Cities fell, the sky burned, and the great seas boiled away as fired rained down from the furious heavens. All that remains are barren ashes. Humanity will never forgive this sin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_homeworld_1;The Homeworld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_homeworld_desc;Earth, the cradle of humanity and the birthplace of countless cultures, religions, and species. On this planet rested all of human history until the year 1969.  Even by 2998, Earth still holds the largest human population in explored space and serves as the capital of the largest single state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_1;Hydroponics Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_1_desc;This world has no real agricultural sector, but the colonists do have the ability to produce some food in specialized hydroponics bays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_2;Gardens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_2_desc;While there are no real farming communities, most settlements on this world have small gardens in which they can grow basic foodstuffs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_3;Farms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_3_desc;Large tracts of land have been set aside for agriculture, and farming communities are beginning to develop. With modern agricultural technology, this world is now producing an actual surplus of food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_4;Large Farms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_4_desc;This world has set aside a considerable portion of arable land for agriculture, and is actively making use of nearly all of it. It is likely that these farms feed a dozen less fortunate planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_5;Vast Farms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_agriculture_q_5_desc;This world's almost perfect climate has enabled it to become home to a vast agricultural sector, who provide food for dozens if not hundreds of worlds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
