String_failed_normal_exam;[This.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [This.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s exam has finally come. Unfortunately, even though the exam was relatively straightforward, you found yourself struggling. You're pretty sure you failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_failed_hard_exam;You finally had to write [This.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [This.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s exam. As expected, it was absolutely brutal - one of the hardest you've ever had to take. The whole situation was hopeless. You're almost certain that you failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL108;Maybe I should have studied more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPSCHOOL109;catches you cheating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL109;Well, this is certainly awkward. [From.GetCrisisFormalName] scored very well on your latest exam. Unfortunately, you have incontrovertible evidence that [From.GetSheHe] cheated. [Root.GetExamCheatingBlackmail];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_exam_cheating_blackmail_from;Of course, [From.GetCrisisInformalName] happens to be a person of some significance outside of [From.GetHerHis] studies. Perhaps there could be benefits to looking the other way, just this once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;xd
String_exam_cheating_blackmail_other;Of course, [From.GetCrisisInformalName] happens to be related to [target_important_person.GetCrisisFormalName] - someone of considerable significance. Perhaps there could be benefits to looking the other way, just this once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL109;Expel [From.GetHerHim] immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSCHOOL109;Let [From.GetHerHim] off with a failing grade and a warning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCSCHOOL109;Let [From.GetHerHim] pass in exchange for a bribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFSCHOOL109;Let [From.GetHerHim] pass as a favor to [target_important_person.GetCrisisFormalName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL110;One of your students, [From.GetCrisisFormalName], has successfully passed your exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL110;Obviously [From.GetSheHe] had an excellent teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL111;One of your students, [From.GetCrisisFormalName], has regretably failed to pass your exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL111;Well, that's a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPSCHOOL112;is expelled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL112;Well, this is a disaster - it appears that your attempt to cheat on [target_professor.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [target_professor.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s exam has been discovered. Even worse, [target_professor.GetSheHe] has decided to expel you from the [target_professor.GetSocietyName] entirely, effective immediately. Your studies there are over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL112;You've got to be kidding me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL113;Troublesome news - your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetCrisisInformalName], has been expelled from the [FromFrom.GetSocietyName] for cheating on [From.GetHerHis] exams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL114;A serious issue has come up - [From.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] has expelled one of [From.GetHerHis] students, [FromFrom.GetCrisisFormalName], for academic misconduct. Specifically, for cheating on [FromFrom.GetHerHis] exams. [FromFrom.GetExpulsionImportance];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_expulsion_context_importance_fromfrom;This is all the more serious an issue because [This.GetCrisisInformalName] is a person of some distinction outside the [Root.GetSocietyName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_expulsion_context_importance_other;This is all the more serious an issue because [This.GetCrisisInformalName] happens to be related to [target_important_person.GetCrisisFormalName], a person of some distinction outside the [Root.GetSocietyName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL114;[From.GetSheHeCap] made the correct decision, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSCHOOL114;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] acted too hastily...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL115;[From.Society.GetGrandmasterTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] has sent you a memo commending you on your decision to swiftly punish academic misconduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL116;[From.Society.GetGrandmasterTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] has sent you a memo reprimanding you for acting "too hastily" in punishing a clear example of academic misconduct. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] cares more about the politics of the situation than academic integrity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPSCHOOL117;fails the exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL117;Well, this is unfortunate. After the exam, [From.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] called you into [From.GetHerHis] office. Apparently, your attempts at cheating weren't as clever or subtle as you thought they were, and you've been caught. Fortunately, [From.GetSheHe] has decided to let you off with just a warning and a failing grade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL117;That was way too close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL118;Well, this is unfortunate. After the exam, [From.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] called you into [From.GetHerHis] office. Apparently, your attempts at cheating weren't as clever or subtle as you thought they were, and you've been caught. [From.GetSheHeCap] gives you an ultimatum: either make a modest donation of one hundred credits, or be expelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL118;I'll pay, I'll pay, just don't expel me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSCHOOL118;A hundred credits? You have to be joking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL119;[From.GetCrisisInformalName] was most agreeable, and has given you a modest donation in exchange for being allowed to continue to attend the [Root.GetSocietyName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL119;A win-win situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL120;Unfortunately, [From.GetCrisisInformalName] apparently values [From.GetHerHis] money more than [From.GetSheHe] values [From.GetHerHis] academic standing - [From.GetSheHe] refuses to pay up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL120;Then I suppose it's time [From.GetSheHe] left this institution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL121;Well, this is unfortunate. After the exam, [From.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] called you into [From.GetHerHis] office. Apparently, your attempts at cheating weren't as clever or subtle as you thought they were, and you've been caught. Fortunately, [From.GetSheHe] assures you that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to look the other way, as a personal favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL121;I suppose this makes us even.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSCHOOL121;I don't like owing you, but I guess I have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCSCHOOL121;I refuse to be blackmailed like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL122;[From.GetCrisisInformalName] proved sensible enough to listen to reason. [From.GetSheHeCap] will be allowed to continue attending the [Root.GetSocietyName], as a personal favor from you to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL122;A win-win situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL123;[From.GetCrisisInformalName] is apparently as foolish as [From.GetSheHe] is dishonest. Despite your generous offer, [From.GetSheHe] has made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] will not be "blackmailed" over [From.GetHerHis] blatant misconduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL123;Then I suppose it's time [From.GetSheHe] left this institution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL125;You've received a private communication from [FromFrom.GetCrisisFormalName], a [FromFrom.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] at the [FromFrom.GetSocietyName]. Apparently, your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetCrisisFormalName], has been less than honest, and cheated on [From.GetHerHis] exams. The punishment for this is expulsion, but [FromFrom.GetCrisisInformalName] is willing to look the other way in exchange for a donation of one hundred credits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL126;Well, this is unfortunate. After the exam, [target_professor.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [target_professor.GetOnlyDynastyName] called you into [target_professor.GetHerHis] office. Apparently, your attempts at cheating weren't as clever or subtle as you thought they were, and you've been caught. Fortunately, your [GetFromRelation] has made certain "arrangements", and you will not be expelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL126;I suppose that's the best I can hope for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL127;[FromFrom.GetCrisisFormalName] is apparently far more sensible than [FromFrom.GetHerHis] relative. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has agreed to provide you with the requested donation - so long as you agree to overlook [From.GetCrisisInformalName]'s misconduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL127;A wise decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL129;It looks like [FromFrom.GetCrisisFormalName] doesn't care as much for [FromFrom.GetHerHis] relative's academic success as you hoped - [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has flatly refused your generous offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL129;Then I suppose expulsion is the only option left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL131;You've received a private communication from [FromFrom.GetCrisisFormalName], a [FromFrom.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] at the [FromFrom.GetSocietyName]. Apparently, your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetCrisisFormalName], has been less than honest, and cheated on [From.GetHerHis] exams. The punishment for this is expulsion, but [FromFrom.GetCrisisInformalName] is willing to look the other way as a personal favor to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL133;[FromFrom.GetCrisisFormalName] is apparently far more sensible than [FromFrom.GetHerHis] relative. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has agreed to let you do [FromFrom.GetHerHim] the favor of overlooking [From.GetCrisisInformalName]'s misconduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL133;A wise decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL140;You're making preparations for an upcoming lecture on [Root.GetExamSubject]. Unfortunately, you're going to have to touch on some controversial subject matter, which means you have a choice - you can either present the correct, [Root.Religion.GetName] point of view on the issue, or you can give equal time to incorrect views in the name of avoiding "bias".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL140;It's wrong to pretend a lie is equal to the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSCHOOL140;I should make sure to consider every point of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL141;Normally, you find [From.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s lectures dull, and you suspect that [From.GetSheHe] does as well. This latest lecture on [From.GetExamSubject], however, was surprisingly interesting. It deftly navigated controversial subject matter, but clarified it for you in a way that made the controversy seem foolish. You feel more confident in your knowledge of the subject than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL141;If only they could all be this enlightening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL142;[From.GetCrisisFormalName] responded very positively to your recent lecture. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems much more confident in [From.GetHerHis] knowledge of the subject matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL142;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL143;You can't believe this! You could barely sit through Professor [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s [From.GetexamSubject] lecture. The entire thing was pure [From.Religion.GetName] drivel, from beginning to end, with no appreciation for the context or nuance of the subject matter. What's worse, you now have to write an assignment on the subject, and you're absolutely certain you'll get a failing grade if you turn in something honest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL143;Suck it up and write what [From.GetSheHe] wants to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSCHOOL143;Reconsider. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] has a point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCSCHOOL143;Refuse to do the assignment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSCHOOL144;[From.GetCrisisFormalName] responded poorly to your recent lecture. [From.GetSheHeCap] turned in [From.GetHerHim] latest assignment, and said all the right things, but there's a highly begrudging tone to it all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL144;Still, [From.GetSheHe]'s earned a passing grade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSCHOOL145;[From.GetCrisisFormalName] responded very positively to your recent lecture. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems much more confident in [From.GetHerHis] knowledge of the subject matter, and even seems to have reconsidered some of [From.GetHerHis] preconceived notions about the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL145;Excellent, the best possible outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL146;[From.GetCrisisFormalName] responded very poorly to your recent lecture. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] has refused to turn in [From.GetHerHis] latest assignment entirely in protest against your "pure [Root.Religion.GetName] drivel".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL146;[From.GetSheHeCap] has a long way to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSCHOOL151;You have a problem. [professor_1.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [professor_1.GetOnlyDynastyName] just gave you an enormous assignment - it's going to take serious effort to complete. On its own, that wouldn't be a problem, but unfortunately, you already have an equally massive assignment from [professor_2.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [professor_2.GetOnlyDynastyName]. You're not sure you have time to finish both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTASCHOOL151;Focus on [professor_1.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [professor_1.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s assignment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBSCHOOL151;Focus on [professor_2.Society.GetSocietyProfessorTitle] [professor_2.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s assignment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCSCHOOL151;Pull an all-nighter to finish both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSCHOOL152;You're impressed with [From.GetCrisisFormalName]'s commitment. Despite the fairly sizable project you assigned to [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] pulled through and got it completed on time with an excellent grade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSCHOOL153;[From.GetCrisisFormalName] has failed to turn in a major assignment. [From.GetSheHeCap] insists that [From.GetHerHis] workload was too much and [From.GetSheHe] simply didn't have time to finish it, but that doesn't explain why [From.GetSheHe] chose to put YOUR class at such a low priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSCHOOL200;It's been a long, hard road, but it's finally over. At an official ceremony on [Root.Society.GetSocietyHeadquarters], [Root.Society.GetGrandmasterTitle] [Root.Society.Grandmaster.GetCrisisFormalName] officially hands you your degree, recognizing you as a graduate of the [Root.Society.GetName][Root.GetFalseGraduation]. [Root.Society.Grandmaster.GetSheHeCap] also politely suggests that it would be appreciated if you joined the university's alumni association, which provides it with regular donations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTASCHOOL301;I see no reason why not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSCHOOL301;Why just be friends when we could be something more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCSCHOOL301;Please, just leave me alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL302;You and your roommate [From.GetCrisisInformalName] seem to be hitting it off well. You find yourself thoroughly enjoying [From.GetHerHis] company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL302;This should be a pleasant year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL303;You and your roommate [From.GetCrisisInformalName] have failed to hit things off. It's not for lack of trying on your part - [From.GetSheHe] just doesn't seem interested in your company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL303;Well, that's frustrating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPSCHOOL304;responds to your attempts at flirting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL304;You've been roommates with [From.GetCrisisFormalName] for a few weeks now, and while at first you were unsure about how [From.GetSheHe] felt, [From.GetHerHis] flirting has become increasingly unsubtle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBSCHOOL304;Try to let [From.GetHerHim] down gently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCSCHOOL304;Shut down [From.GetHerHis] advances entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL305;Your roommate [From.GetFirstName] responded positively to your advances. Very positively. The two of you might just be looking at a beautiful future together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL305;Amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL306;You take a chance and open your heart to [From.GetCrisisInformalName] - and immediately regret it. [From.GetSheHeCap] shuts you down. Hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL306;This is the worst day of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL307;Your attempts at flirting with [From.GetCrisisInformalName] haven't worked out. At all. [From.GetSheHeCap] has noticed, that much is clear, but [From.GetSheHe] has also made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] has no romantic interest in you whatsoever. [From.GetSheHeCap] wants to just be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL307;Well, friendship is almost as good as love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBSCHOOL307;...maybe we should just keep to ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCSCHOOL307;"Friends?" [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks [From.GetSheHe] can reject me and still be FRIENDS?!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL308;...apparently, [From.GetCrisisInformalName] doesn't take rejection well. At all. [From.GetSheHeCap] is absolutely furious at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSCHOOL309;Your new roommate, [From.GetCrisisFormalName], is a complete pain in your ass. [From.GetSheHeCap] doesn't like you, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to make sure you know it. You've tried to keep your distance and ignore [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] is having none of it, picking a fight at every opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL309;Just get out of my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSCHOOL310;You've been assigned your room for this year at the [Root.Society.GetName], and this year, you'll be rooming with [From.GetCrisisFormalName][From.GetRoommateDescription] Over the first few weeks of your time together, however, it's become clear that [From.GetSheHe] is deliberately avoiding you. You get the feeling [From.GetSheHe] doesn't like you much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASCHOOL310;That's fair, we'll get along better if we stay apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
