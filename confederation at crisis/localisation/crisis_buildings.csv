ca_wildlife_leviathan;Xenofauna: Leviathan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_leviathan_desc;This planet is inhabited by leviathans, the largest animals in known space. Leviathans are enormous, cold-blooded, serpentine, scaled aquatic animals that normally dwell near the surface of the sea, feeding on the dense holopelagic algae of Kimbilio II's Golden Ocean. The largest documented leviathan was three kilometers long, and was host to fungal symbiots that could be mistaken for small islets when it was at rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_ratatosuku;Xenofauna: Ratatosuku;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_ratatosuku_desc;This planet is inhabited by ratatosuku, a species of large, furry, six-limbed arboreal herbivores.

ca_wildlife_koloss;Xenofauna: Koloss;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_koloss_desc;This planet is inhabited by kolossy, the largest land animals in known space.

They are fiercely territorial, even posing a danger to colonial settlements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_paraisan_wolf;Xenofauna: Paraisan Wolf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_paraisan_wolf_desc;This planet is inhabited by Paraisan wolves, a species of scaled, warm-blooded pack predators native to Paraiso III. The most remarkable feature of the Paraisan wolf is its ability to not only sense radio waves with its prominent antennae, but to emit weak ones and modulate their frequency. It uses this capability to silently communicate with its packmates while hunting, greatly improving the pack's stealth and coordination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_lei_niao;Xenofauna: Lei Niao;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_lei_niao_desc;This planet is inhabited by lei niao, a species of large, feathered, bipedal, herd-dwelling herbivores. Lei niao are known both for their colorful plumage and for the size of the herds which roam Niu Cunlan Prime's southern plains, which often in the hundreds. Their name refers to the sound made when such a herd stampedes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_tunnel_cat;Xenofauna: Tunnel Cat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_tunnel_cat_desc;This planet is inhabited by tunnel cats, a species of warm-blooded, hairless, burrowing animals native to Nae Bangladesa II. Tunnel cats are omnivorous scavengers that pose a constant threat to small farming communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_mimic;Xenofauna: Mimic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_mimic_desc;This planet is inhabited by mimics, an arboreal invertebrate species native to the jungles of Nahui-Ahtle II.

ca_wildlife_chouten_oni;Xenofauna: Chouten-oni;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_chouten_oni_desc;This planet is inhabited by chouten-oni, the apex predators of the jungles of Nara III. There are many species of chouten-oni, but all of them are six-limbed, cold-blooded carnivores with thick leathery skin and a single prominent horn. They are known for their surprising speed, and have occasionally been known to attack humans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_ghuul;Xenofauna: Ghuul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_ghuul_desc;This planet is inhabited by ghuuls, a species of warm-blooded, four-limbed scavengers with thick leathery skin, native to the dark side of the tidally locked Dawaamah al-Lahib. Ghuuls are notable for their ability to mimic the cries of several common predatory animals, which they use to drive away their own predators, as most life on the dark side of the planet is blind and relies exclusively on sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_monoceros;Xenofauna: Monoceros;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_monoceros_desc;This planet is inhabited by monoceroses, a species of warm-blooded, four-limbed, fiercely territorial grazers with bright feathers, native to Nimue. The monoceros is so named for the female's prominent horn, which is used both as a weapon to defend its territory and in competition for mates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_bai_gui;Xenofauna: Bai Gui;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_bai_gui_desc;This planet is inhabited by bai gui, a species of white-furred, bipedal pack predators native to the southern tundras of Guanzhou III. The bai gui is so named for its ability to move almost completely silently and to suppress its own body heat, which combined with its natural camoflage makes it almost impossible to spot before it strikes, even with thermal imaging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_warhound;Xenofauna: Warhound;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_warhound_desc;Regretably, this planet is inhabited by warhounds, an old experimental Confederate bioweapon devised in the late 28th century. Superficially resembling a Terran panther, the warhound is a fantastic tracker gifted with great speed, strength, and agility. Ultimately, they proved intelligent enough for specimens to escape from containment on a number of worlds, and the resulting scandal forced the Confederation to abandon the project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_ultravore;Xenofauna: Ultravore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_ultravore_desc;This planet is inhabited by ultravores, a genetically engineered species of herd-dwelling, grazing mammals with extremely thick hide, capable of consuming and digesting nearly any material. Ultravores were intended to be used to assist with terraforming by completely eradicating dangerous grass species such as Pu-erh's razorgrass, but ultimately proved too destructive to a planet's native environment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_roykrysa;Xenofauna: Roykrysa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wildlife_roykrysa_desc;This planet is inhabited by roykrysas, a small, furry, warm-blooded, egg-laying species native to Prochnost' IV. In their native habitat, roykrysas are a mere nuisance, with many natural predators, but a handful of roykrysas stowed away on cargo ships have been brought to other worlds, where their powerful immune systems and high reproduction rate have led to massive population explosions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
