BM_CRISIS_OF_THE_CONFEDERATION_DESC;It is the year 2998, and galactic civilization stands on the brink of collapse. Led by the charismatic politician Juan Lebedev, a coalition of periphery states have joined together in declaring their independence from the TERRAN CONFEDERATION.\n\nIn the face of this rebellion, the Confederation places its hopes in newly-elected President Morgan Afolayan and the good men and women of the CONFEDERATE SPACE COMMAND, charged with returning the defiant outer rim to Earth's control. As darkness falls across the galaxy, ships speed forth from Earth for the first great battle in nearly five hundred years...;Nous sommes en 2998, et la civilisation galactique est au bord de l'effondrement. Dirigée par le charismatique politicien Juan Lebedev, une coalition d'états périphériques se sont réunis pour déclarer leur indépendance de laConfédération terrienne.\n\nPour contrer cette rébellion, la Confédération a placé ses espoirs dans le nouveau président Morgan Afolayan et dans les bons citoyens et citoyennes de la Commandement Spatial Confédéré, chargés de faire revenir les rebelles de la ceinture extérieure sous le joug terrien. Alors que l'obscurité gagne à travers la galaxie, les navires accélèrent vers la Terre pour la plus grande bataille des cinq cents dernières années ...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_WARLORDS_DESC;The TERRAN CONFEDERATION, once synonymous with the very concept of human civilization, has collapsed underneath the weight of its failures. Terran Authority has all but evaporated and left none but powerful WARLORDS in charge of billions of souls as brother duels brother in mad attempts to restore the peace. \n\nIn the corners of burning cities and piles of wasted lives, some begin to question what lengths should they stoop to stop the chaos. With every million casualty "skirmish", the bar continues to descend.  With most of humanity in the hands of a few what will become of this once proud race? While some use their power to slowly rebuild, there are others who wish to put their mark on humanity forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_11112833;"It takes a peculiar sort of mind to witness the horrors of the Crisis and still say, 'Yes, democracy will be our salvation.'"\n - Captain-General Tao Luo, 3007\n\nThe disasters of the late 30th century caused many Terrans to lose their faith in democracy. Terran Imperialists seek to unite humanity under the rule of a strong, authoritarian government centered on Earth.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_11112833; Tao Luo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_11113974;The daughter of former president Morgan, Lorane became the youngest CEO of the Afolayan Corporation when her mother was  imprisoned indefinitely by Captain-General Tao during his coup. With the support of the newly independent Zenye Nyota Angani, Lorane seeks justice against Tao and and the Terran Imperialists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_11113974;Lorane Afolayan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_113167;Jakob is son to the infamous former president Owen, CEO of the Weyland Corporation, whose incompetent rule many say led to the Confederation's downfall. Can Jakob help the Frontier restore prosperity to the region and remove the stain from his family's reputation, or will the Weyland Corporation forever be remembered as the family whose transgressions unintentionally unraveled the Confederation into chaos?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_113167;Jakob Weyland II;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1234931;When Alejandra joined the Solar Cult against her family's wishes, the furthest thing on her mind was the prospect of ruling her family's Megacorporation, considering she was the youngest of several sisters and had conflicting values.  In the aftermath of the Confederate Civil War she seized control of the Vega Sector and the family corporation to become the only independent power ruled by the Solar Cult. With aggressive Terran Imperials on one side seeking to retake the de-jure Confederate land and end corporate rule, and the Pilgrim state of Tierra Celeste seeking to unite the region on the other, will Alejandra and the Salazar Corporation be able to endure?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1234931;Alejandra Salazar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1102803;The state of Tierra Celeste, though having a majority population of Pilgrims and Sect Adoptionists had long been administered by secular rulers.  During the civil unrest following Tao's Imperialist takeover, a Pilgrim was finally elected to lead the religious state.  Now that the faithful have seceded from the Confederation there is uncertainty about how President Agustina will continue to maintain their historical core function of transporting pilgrims to the holy sites on Earth. Mexica Sect Adoptionists are urging her to embrace the many suns for any chance at fully eliminating reliance on Terra and remaining independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1102803;Agustina al-Zahawi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1104689;Admiral Andres of the Helix Rangers was tasked by Captain-General Tao to restore the Helix Nebula to Confederate control after the anarchy subsided.  Andres has other plans, instead defecting to become a pirate, leaving the Confederation with no means to reclaim the nebula without first taking back the Balkanized region of the Centauri Reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1104689;Pirate Admiral Andres Mejia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_11020019;Victoria Locksley XIV;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_11020019;"The great problem with benevolent despotism was the notorious mortality of despots." - Victoria Locksley I, 2505\n\nAfter the traitorous Joseph Blackburn's coup succeeded in 2996, Victoria, a 14th generation clone of the original founder of Avalon, was forced into exile. The young usurper Arthur has pardoned Victoria against his regent's wishes in the hopes of receiving a marriage alliance to cement his rule, but her guardian Edward Firestone has recently given her control of the Chalice Star System in a ploy to garner support for the Bio-Directionists to take back Avalon from the misguided Neo Feudalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1101422;Duke Joseph VII of Galahad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1101422;An unusual Vanity State, Avalon's founders believed that the greatest danger to good government was the morality of good dictatorship could endure forever. Recently, however, a streak of romanticism has emerged among the clone aristocracy, and the Duke of Galahad has overthrown the traditional ruling family, replacing them with a boy he claims to be a clone of the legendary King Arthur. The new regime faces both the threat of the Confederation, and those still loyal to the previous rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1106139;President Anika of Mukta Duniyeh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1106139;Once a region made up of dozens of tiny independent colonies and Vanity States, with their roots in al-Samawat and Terran India, Mukta Duniya attempted to remain neutral in the Crisis. Earth considered this treason, and now they have been forced to come together to fight a war they never wanted to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_11011583;Secretary Kirill of Strugatsky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_11011583;Old dreams die hard, dreams of utopia harder still. Strugatsky was the result of Gagarin and Tereshkovan colonists who blamed Russia's fall from grace on its abandonment of socialism. The country is governed by an officially meritocratic bureaucracy, and is remarkably internally stable. However, it faces severe external problems, as its armed forces are relatively weak and both of the state's neighbors, Novyy Edem and Jion, are militaristic and ideologically opposed to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_111695;Catherine of The Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_111695;The Frontier region was settled under the auspices of the North Atlantic Space Agency, bringing colonists from the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Western Europe. The Republic of the Frontier deliberately modeled itself on the early United States, invoking the American Declaration of Independence during its secession from Earth in the 24th century, and as such is a federal republic. Like the Terran Commonwealth, however, the Frontier has fallen prey to wealthy business interests, and is now largely controlled by the Weyland Corporation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1104069;Governor Fatima of al-Samawat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1104069;Al-Samawat is a nation of paradoxes. Settled under the authority of the Space Exploration Treaty of Cairo, its initial settlers consisted of Middle Eastern and North African countries, and many of them brought with them strong religious influences. Today, the Pilgrimage has its strongest roots here, where all able-bodied adults are expected to journey to Earth at least once in their lifetimes, but it has also become the center of a technological renaissance. Within its borders, transhumanists and religious traditionalists clash as the nation tries to determine its future course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1104754;Commissioner Jian of Xingjie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1104754;Of all the Core World colonies, Xingjie shares the closest ties to Earth. Founded by a single nation, the People's Republic of China, Xingjie joined the Colonial Revolution of 2352 only because they believed Earth could no longer provide for their defense, and they are now proud supporters of the Confederation. Officially, Xingjie is governed by an elected president, but in practice its immense, meritocratic bureaucracy is largely self-governing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_11020008;Simba of Zenye Nyota Angani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_11020008;The African Space Agency was long deemed a joke by most of the world. Officially run by the African Union but dominated by the continent's most power nations, the organization only managed to achieve success with the construction of the Lagos Space Elevator, the first home-built African space elevator and the gateway to the stars that would bring about the birth of Zenye Nyota Angani. Like most of its neighbors, it is culturally diverse, with sectors representing a wide variety of African cultures, which in turn had led it to become one of the Confederation's most federal legacies, as well as one of the most committed to democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_11111872;Admiral Arkady of Novy Edem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_11111872;Novyy Edem is often considered the epitome of the Vanity State, a colony born and forged from the vision of a single would-be messiah. Novyy Edem's founders were followers of the Astrist philosophy, and Novyy Edem is nationally governed as if the entire nation were a single starship. In practice, its seven protectorates are family fiefdoms, and the Solomonov family controls its leadership. In the wake of the Anarchy, their newly independent neighbors in the Helix Nebula could be vital in unlocking the power needed to defeat their treacherous former ally Xin Zizhiqu in the inevitable second Maoxian War to take back their stolen system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1105853;Karthik of Tarka;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1105853;Once considered to be simply the largest state of Mukta Duniya, Tarka refused to join the Republic, instead taking up arms against the Confederation directly. It was founded by disillusioned Samawati transhumanists, and is the largest transhumanist state in the galaxy. The Tarkans are known throughout the galaxy for their use of cybernetics, and often distrusted as being not entirely human, but their military might is always respected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_110126980;Abbot Jian Xu of Diyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_110126980;"Out of all the countless worlds of humanity, it seems a convenient coincidence that the oldest and most worthy of respect would also be the most powerful and prideful." - Abbot Jie Xu, 2989\n\nWhile nearly all religions venerate Earth as the Sacred World and the birthplace of humanity, there are those who refuse to acknowledge this fact. "Xenoterran" theology posits that humanity was created on some other world, and that the primacy of Earth is therefore completely unmerited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_1326139;Director-General Julieta of Miltia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1326139;Often derogatorily referred to as "Toaster Worshippers," the Machine Cult are a strange Cyberneticist sect who seem to regard the mechanical with outright religious reverence. They believe that the flesh is a physical manifestation of sin, and seek to convert as much of themselves as possible to metal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Xin_Zizhiqu;Xin Zizhiqu was opened up for free colonization by Xingjie in the early 26th century, and had become an hodgepodge of many diverse cultures and governments before coming together in a united republic to combat Terran oppression and the Edmite Invasion of 2998. After winning the Maoxian War against Novy Edem, the federal government began centralizing power, much to the dismay of its disparate sectors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Bianjing;Unlike Xin Ziziqu, Bianjing's settlement was a formal affair, conducted directly by the Xingjie government. As tensions in the Periphery began to rise, the Bianjing Central Authority declared martial law, putting most of its sectors under military rule. This would prove to be its undoing, as the Bianjing Militia had developed strong colonial sympathies. A military coup saw the overthrow of the civilian government and the establishment of a federal junta comprised of the commanders of the various military defense zones in 2997. They have become a stable isolationist power in the wake of the Anarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
