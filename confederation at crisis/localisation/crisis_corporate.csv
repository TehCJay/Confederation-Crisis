fp_hq_2;Medium Corporate Headquarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_hq_2_desc;Already a massive interstellar company, the firms continued growth has forced it to expand, to the point where it now dominates the metropolis it resides in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_hq_3;Large Corporate Headquarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_hq_3_desc;Organisms grow or they die and the company is no exception. Its headquarters dominate, the region it is based in and satellite firm's campuses sprawl across the planet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_hq_4;Massive Corporate Headquarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_hq_4_desc;When people speak of "the Man" they think of you. Your headquarters is the defacto administrative center of the star system, a beating heart that brings life and wealth to all who draw near it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_robotics_1;Robotics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_robotics_1_desc;The robotics engineering department manufactures advanced autonomous mechanisms for industrial, home and military use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_robotics_2;Robotics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_robotics_2_desc;The provision of increased funding has at last allowed engineers in the robots department to meet the abnormally high standards for reliability they've set. While not glamorous it gives us a reputation for quality and a leg up over our competitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_robotics_3;Robotics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_robotics_3_desc;Further funds and expansion have allowed progress on the long delayed issue of artificial intelligence. It is a delicate balance between smart enough to be useful and constrained enough to not cause problems, but it appears you have traveled further down this path than anyone before if the ability of your engineers to beat the stock market with their new creations is any indication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_randd_1;Research and Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fp_industrial_2;Industrial Engineering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_industrial_2_desc;Improvements in our firm's chemical and refining processes have resulted in the ability to exact usable raw materials from almost anything. While the market value of such items isn't extraordinary, the applications for industrial processes which demand a constant stream of raw material is incredible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_industrial_3;Industrial Engineering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_industrial_3_desc;Our construction capabilities are unparalleled; our engineers can do anything from construct massive industrial plants on virgin planets, mine landfills, reshape continents and terraform worlds. The only thing outside their reach are projects on the scale of a ringworld... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_consumer_1;Consumer Products;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_consumer_1_desc;The consumer products department is tasked with the production and retail of common home and consumer use commodities, such as food, clothing and small appliances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_consumer_2;Consumer Products;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_consumer_2_desc;Standardized products like the ones originating from here are marked by very thin margins making every productivity gain hard fought. However the lessons learnt about efficiency, management and organization are universally applicable insuring the departments continued funding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_consumer_3;Consumer Products;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_consumer_3_desc;Nothing quite captures the sheer scale of your consumer good product line than the production of a trillion forks. If it is in a person's home there are good odds it was originally dreamt up here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_transports_1;Transportation and Automotive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_transports_1_desc;The transportation and automotive department, besides producing a variety of vehicles (ranging from private hover cars to colossal tunnelers), also puts them to use, operating interstellar passenger and freight transport lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_transports_2;Transportation and Automotive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_transports_2_desc;The transportation division as diversified; no longer focused on just the just the private transportation and it shipping, now it produces a least one model in every product line. Sports jets, mopeds, rocket skateboards, dune buggies, long range cargo haulers- no matter if your world covered with urban centers or an untamed wilderness, you'll find a solution that fits your needs here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_transports_3;Transportation and Automotive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_transports_3_desc;Another day, another breakthrough. The newest innovation is collapsible cars. While all the bugs haven't been worked out, you've now deployed vehicles that fold themselves down into a manageable size, eliminating much of the traditional issues with parking that accumulate in large urban centers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_weapons_1;Defense Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_weapons_1_desc;The defense industries department is dedicated to the production of weapons and military equipment, ranging from the simplest firearm to fighters and attack vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_weapons_2;Defense Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_weapons_2_desc;One of the few places where people ironically talk about "death rays", work continues on new ways to kill. Monomolecular knives, antimatter bombs, gyrojets rifles are not currently militarily feasible, but the employees hard at work here are confident they will be able to change that- with continued funding of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_weapons_3;Defense Industries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_weapons_3_desc;The boys in the backroom keep on churning out a sea of bizarrely code named projects- by far the most terrifying being the "Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo"- while the rest of the department works on refining the results to something practical. Many of the improved methods of destruction are more disturbingly effective than what a sane person would want. Still, better in our hands than those of the Zooks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fp_biotech_2;Biotech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_biotech_2_desc;It is an old dream to replace industrial processes with agricultural ones and here some of them have been realized. While not as good as ones produced by industry, they are invaluable on frontier worlds that are strapped for cash. However by far the most popular plants are those that make alcohol which have expanded the liquor industry to the point where everything fermentable has a drink based upon it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_biotech_3;Biotech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_biotech_3_desc;The intelligent pet genre has been a popular one as long as anyone can remember and its come one step closer to reality. While you haven't quite gotten to the point of printing out pokemon, your creations are smart enough that people have been raising the prospect of ethical guidelines.

fp_finance_2;Financial Services;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_finance_2_desc;The trick in finances is to use as much of your money as possible will still keeping enough on hand that sudden shocks don't cause you to fold like a house of cards. Not being able to conjure funds out of thin air, the accounting department has still managed to achieve a minor miracle by taking shortening the lag time on internal and external transactions, insuring that the money spends just that much more time working in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_finance_3;Financial Services;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_finance_3_desc;Economies of scale provide massive advantages for insurance and you are now capable of enjoying them fully. Even the destruction of a solar system or the death of a CEO no longer has enough pull to bring down stock prices significantly.

fp_luxury_2_desc;Conspicuous consumption is a constant friend and people with more money than sense continue to provide a useful revenue stream. Gloves made from an individuals cloned skin, homes than can shift their rooms on command, designer drugs, food with no calories- there is no end to the decadence or money it brings in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_luxury_3;Luxury Goods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_luxury_3_desc;At this level of customer wealth the goal is less to make money and more to insure a good working relationship with the movers and shakers of the galaxy. From building a pleasure palace with a stable of sexbots, a cathedral that rises into space or reshaping an ecology to produce candy nothing is impossible or too expensive to reach and exceed customer expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_port_1_desc;Preferential treatment means the local facilities have organized themselves to accommodate your merchant ships, minimizing the turnaround time they face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_port_2_desc;Expansion to the spaceport allows a higher peak load to accommodate sudden changes in imports and exports. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_port_3_desc;A system of tugs and scattered deep space off loading points allows time critical merchandise to be moved from system to system without delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_enclave_1_desc;Marketing has established a permanent office here. We now have direct access to all the major players in this system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_enclave_2_desc;Marketing has extensive cooperation with local firms. We can track their new products and construction and discover the resulting shifts in demand before anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_enclave_3_desc;Marketing has tabs on the local culture, from the street scene to the university lecture halls. If a new fad pops up we can package and sell it before anyone else scoops it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_garrison_1_desc;Rent-a-Cops and the best anti theft system money can buy defend our interests here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_garrison_2_desc;An agreement with the local governor means our facilities are considered vital local resources and defended by the SDF in times of trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_garrison_3_desc;Professional troops guard this facility. While not drawn from the highest quality recruits, their firepower and prepared defenses are enough to deter any thing short of space based weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
