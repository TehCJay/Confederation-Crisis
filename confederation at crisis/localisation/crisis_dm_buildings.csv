ca_primary_q_0;Outpost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_0_desc;This world holds only a single, small settlement, barely worthy of the title. There are no permanent inhabitants here - it is inhabited only by a crew of a few hundred at most, assigned here as part of their duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_1;Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_1_desc;This world is inhabited, but only just. There may be anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand people on the world, and at least a few of them have decided to make their homes here permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_2;Inhabited World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_2_desc;This world has a significant permanent population, measuring in the hundreds of thousands. Most of the population live in rural farming communities, with the only real city being the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_3;Urbanized World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_3_desc;This world has a large permanent population, numbering in the millions. While a narrow majority of the population still live in rural farming communities, there are also many major cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_4;Conurbanized World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_4_desc;This world has a huge permanent population, numbering in the billions. The majority of the population live in cities, and the largest such have spread out to the point where it often difficult to tell where one city ends and the next begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_5;Ecumenopolis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_5_desc;This world supports an unthinkably vast population, numbering in the trillions. With the exception of designated agricultural areas, the entire world has effectively become consumed by ubanization and transformed into a single contiguous city-scape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_gunship_hangar_q_1;Gunship Hangar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_gunship_hangar_q_1_desc;This small hangar is used to store the few gunships of the local militia. These gunships are used for local law enforcement and to deter the casual pirate. They work by launching kinetic projectiles at a short range at ships that for any reason can't dodge but might have point-defense, for example troop transports, or normal passenger transports that might be carrying criminals or illegal cargo, these ships can't dodge the Gunships bullets without harming their occupants. Sadly, gunships are almost totally useless in long range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_missileship_hangar_q_1_desc;This place stores any kind of ship that launches guided weapons, not necessarily classic rockets with warheads, they could be slugs with engines, or even small drones with their own weaponry. The advantage of such weapons is that enemies attempting to dodge them can be pursued anyway, their disvantage is that they are vulnerable to countermeasures, point defense, or craft commanders that can force them to take paths that waste their propellant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_destroyer_hanger_q_1_desc;Orbital shipyards allow the construction of destroyers escorts which cannot easily be constructed in a gravity well, being capital ships. Destroyers Escorts are armed with a variety of weapons their main purpose is defend larger ships such as freighters and troop transports from attacking frigates such as the ever popular Gunships. Their main disvantage is not having big main weapons that would allow destruction of enemy capital ships at longe range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_destroyer_hanger_q_2;Destroyer Escort Hangar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_destroyer_hanger_q_2_desc;Vacuum docking and maintenance facilities for destroyers. These ships have complements consisting of a few dozen crew that can live on the ships during wartime or deployment. While these ships are just small enough to land on planets, this is generally avoided as their powerful engines would level entire cities in such attempt and most never land from fabrication in orbital shipyards to when they're scraped. Destroyers Escorts are armed with a variety of weapons their main purpose is defend larger ships such as freighters and troop transports from attacking frigates such as the ever popular Gunships.

ca_capital_factory_q_1;Battleship Drydock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_capital_factory_q_1_desc;These are facilities mostly in space, for the training, support, storage and construction of large capital ships, mainly Battleships. The Battleship was thought for a while to be obsolete, with everyone just lobbing missiles at each other from long distances, but eventually anti-missile defences started to win the race, not only in space but even in oceans of the planets, Battleships are the main way to fix this issue, they have all kinds of weapons, missiles included, but they all also were built around some kind of spinal heavy energy weapon, that overcome diffraction and dispersion with sheer power output, allowing them to shoot down targets in the initial phases of long range battles with almost no defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_turrets_q_1;Turrets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_1_desc;Generally planetary cannons and stationary turrets will not actually seriously damage any invading ships thanks to their (relatively) short effective range.  However, they work as an excellent deterrent against most bombing runs and can cripple troop landing attempts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_2;Turrets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_2_desc;The first step towards improving the survivability of defenses is to connect them to a large scale heat sink. Having an icesheet or other substance with a high specific heat allows the planet's weapons to run their shields longer and contest invasions more effectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_3;Turrets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_3_desc;The new pop-up design allows defenses to hide underneath terrain features, only exposing themselves for their limited firing period. While this is not an effective disguise, the deeper location of the defenses and ability to prevent them from being obstructed means they are harder to mission kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_4;Turrets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_4_desc;A chain is only as strong as its weakest link and in the case of planetary defenses this is often the targeting equipment. The most effective setup is also generally the most exposed forcing us to use less effective methods when defending. We've managed to alleviate this by disguising a network of sensors as space junk. While it won't stand up to long term scrutiny, the presence or even possibility of its presence, will slow down assaults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_5;Turrets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_turrets_q_5_desc;Terrain mapping is advanced enough that having popup defenses isn't enough. However the solution to that is obviously- block their line of sight. By dispersing a large amount of specially designed contaminants we can make the atmosphere opaque and hide our positions. They will still be able to back track our shots, but now the usage of mobile defenses insures the attacker cannot be sure they took out everything unless they strike with overwhelming force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_1;Scout Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_1_desc;Regular scouting patrols along with a network of small outposts are excellent for protecting against surprise attacks and locating valuable resource deposits.  The R-1 All Terrain rover or RAT rover is the cornerstone of these operations on planets.  Space based scouts usually rely on small work platforms often called Bird Nests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_2;Scout Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_2_desc;Additional scouts allow bird nests to be placed in closer proximity, reducing the amount of potential blind spots in the network and providing more time for economic activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_3;Scout Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_3_desc;Improvements in the sensor system have both bolstered the ability to detect incoming ships as well as locating new deposits of useful materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_4;Scout Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_4_desc;The constant usage of scouts normally results in a degree of wear and tear that keep many in the maintenance bay. With further expansion of the scouting fleet we are now able to repair many before the damage is severe enough to cripple them and conduct repairs in a more assembly line fashion, resulting in a higher proportion of scouts available for deployment. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_5;Scout Patrols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_scout_patrols_q_5_desc;Systematic mapping of the entire area has revealed all the possible extractable wealth of the region, as well as the plenty of minor "obstacles". we can use those as force multipliers, freeing up a significant portion of the scouting fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_1;Barracks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_1_desc;Ship to ship combat and ground invasions are two very different things. Yet both need a number of infantry soldiers, Marines or Army, to reach their goals, this building complex is where they live, store their weapons and mobile armors, and train, further advances in Xenostudies would allow cramming even more people into a limited space.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_2;Barracks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_2_desc; Field training and combat exercises are the classic way to prepare troops for war. While setting aside a big enough area is a hassle and the equipment attrition a pain, no one can deny the effectiveness of large scale formation exercises over our previous efforts. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_3;Barracks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_3_desc;Urban combat is bloody so it is only natural we should attempt to improve training in that aspect. Building replica cities for the troops to fight in is expensive (especially given their tendency to destroy them), but nothing gives them a feel for the specific way they have to move, plan and fight quite like this experience does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_4;Barracks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_4_desc;Unlike space based equipment, those use for ground battles is a lot easier to recover. That fact means we can rather easily have our troops do their training with access to the gear of our enemies, letting them get an insight into their opponent and figure out how to kill them more efficiently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_5;Barracks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_5_desc;With individual training down to a science, the next issue is coordinating the movement of the mass of invasion ships. Planet wide training is not enough as in the event of a war they are expected to coordinate with other worlds levies. The only alternative is to schedule invasion practices involving marines from multiple star systems and gaining experience in running an invasion without snags through the experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_6;Barracks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marine_quarters_q_6_desc;At this point the sheer number of troops available is staggering; the issue of logistics is now the bottleneck to be overcome as the intense fighting can quickly drain the munitions of individual detachments. By making these resources more modular and pooled we can resupply units as needed with having the system back up and allowing us to support truly massive invasion fleets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_1;Tunneler Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_1_desc;A specialized factory used to fabricate and maintain the delicate framework needed to build the special drives equipped on tunnelers as well as provide a storage area for these ships.  These unwieldy ships are capable of creating FTL wakes or tunnels that allow other ships to travel great distances without the need of using artificial wormholes.  The incredible fragility of the tunneler drive combined with its unpredictable nature when destroyed make ships equipped with them unsuited to combat of any kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_2;Tunneler Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_2_desc;Quality assurance is one of the major areas of concern when it comes to tunneler drives. Due to their fragile nature, having a batch that would have been acceptable in other contexts leads to a bunch of useless scrap in this field. With the larger factory we can add in a new suite of sensors to check for micro fractures and other imperfections that previous went unnoticed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_3;Tunneler Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_3_desc;Constant scrutiny isn't enough to make sure the tunnelers meet fleet standards. Numerous field tests in controlled environments allow us to weed out and repair the defective craft, insuring that more are available for service when they are needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_4;Tunneler Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_4_desc;Improvements in tunnelers generally involve adding more power and upgrading the frame to take it. This time is no different and we've refitted the yards for the new and more powerful ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_5;Tunneler Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_5_desc;Quality demands have reached new heights and new measures have to be undertaken to meet them. We've put the factory in constant communication with the mines, smelters and fabricators to watch the quality of the raw materials. Even if something doesn't exactly meet specifications, we can compensate for it by changing the composition we use from other sources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_6;Tunneler Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_6_desc;Is there such a thing as enough power? The new drives produce a prodigal amount of waste heat and cooling systems have been enhanced to insure neither the factory machinery or drive is damaged during testing. For the first time tugs have to be used to move it away from the facility; while the backwash of the drive isn't too dangerous, it messes with sensors and other vulnerable externals. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_7;Tunneler Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_7_desc;We've finally developed a new drive working on entirely new principles. This is a historic breakthrough... and means we have to replace almost all of our previous factory equipment. Oh well, we will build it even bigger this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_8;Tunneler Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tunneler_factory_q_8_desc;With a new drive and lower required tolerances for the parts we can now use more normal manufacturing techniques. Needless to say output has started to match what we've come to expect of automated assembly lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_1;Shipyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_1_desc;Orbital construction facilities for spacecraft.  In addition to keeping the local hangars full, the construction bays can be used for ship storage.  The factories are a constant buzz of activity.  There is always some part of terran space that needs something built.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_2;Shipyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_2_desc;As the size of ships increase, facilities to repair and service them must grow to match. While not capable of building the largest capital ships in known space, this shipyard is capable of supplying and refitting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_3;Shipyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_3_desc;Assembly line manufacturing can finally be extended to capital ships. Unlike planetary manufacturing plants, zero g allows the different modules to easily both relocate and send their work to the next station, resulting in what looks uncannily like a ballet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_4;Shipyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_4_desc;Running out of parts is an issue even in this day and age, but now our facility is large enough to fabricate them on its own. While nowhere near the efficiency of dedicated manufacturing plants, it insures that nothing can halt production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_5;Shipyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spaceyard_q_5_desc;The last avenue for further production aside from simply increases in sizes is disassembling old craft. Normally not a useful resource due to obsolete parts and the stress it puts on their frames, advanced equipment lets us overcome that, effectively giving us a larger raw material supply and reducing the halting caused by waiting for new upgrades and other advances to trickle down from the research labs to the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_1;Command Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_1_desc;This command nexus is the heart of any major military operation.  It is here that the upper echelons of the navy plan and determine plans of attack, defense, and positioning.  The exceptional officers who serve here, take their experience with them when they go on to captain large capital ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_2;Command Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_2_desc;Fleet exercises are an essential component of war preparation and we've extended the previous program. Where once we just had TEWTs (Tactical Exercises Without Troops) or the occasional dry close in system, we now do month long live exercises over a wider and more varied volume of space. This forces our officers to deal with military friction- sensors err, systems break down, crew tire- providing the type of uncertainty seen during actual combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_3;Command Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_3_desc;Rotating officers from the front to provide their skills, viewpoints and experience is a important addition to this facilities planning and educational capabilities. While it isn't generally possible to get the captain of a dreadnought, we can get executive officers and bridge crew to contribute, allowing the officers training here a better idea of how they are expected to fit into the command structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_4;Command Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_4_desc;Familiarizing oneself with the layout of the ship is an important, thankless and time consuming task. To deal with that, we have managed to acquire derelict copies of capital ships. While the officers here gripe about it being a waste of time, the speed at which they assimilate to the fleet has lead to plenty of glowing recommendations from captains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_5;Command Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_command_center_q_5_desc;Although it is rare, on occasion we manage to capture enemy capital ships. Being able to examine their setup and seeing their tactical viewpoint is a major boon to the staff here, improving both planning and the quality of officers produced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_fleet_support_q_1_desc;Staging areas, repair stations, and other infrastructure that can be used to help maintain a standing fleet of spacecraft.  A large and complex network can easily keep several systems worth of ships operating in space constantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_2;Fleet Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_2_desc;Mobile manufactories are now supported by this base. While not as robust or efficient as static factories, they allow us to produce supplies on site, reducing the amount of war material our merchant marine has to transport to the fleet during offensives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_3;Fleet Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_3_desc;A web of agreements with the merchant marine now lets us take advantage of their logistic capabilities during wartime without totally destroying our economy. By skimming off the vessels with the least usage and distributing their routes among existing convoys we can even keep the disruption to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_4;Fleet Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_4_desc;Not just the fleet, but the normal civilian economy has a bit of slack in it. We can take advantage of that and access things that can be retrofitted for military advantage, letting us support a larger fleet without incurring ever escalating costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_fleet_support_q_5_desc;Loot is such an ugly word- requisition would be better. By improving our inspection and quality control we can use supplies seized from the enemy fleet or their worlds without having to worry about inferior quality or sabotage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_6;Fleet Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_6_desc;To take advantage of the new bounty that has fallen into our lab, we've developed new manufactories for the logistics department. The end goal is to be able to have gear that allows us to use foreigners tools without the reverse being true. It is a never ending competition as they also are investing in similar tricks, but failing to compete in this Red Queen's Race would kill our ability to commandeer what we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_7;Fleet Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_7_desc;On of the issues of logistics is that it can often give the game away- an enemy seeing supplies relocated to the front can predict an offensive because supplies unlike ships, are not something that can be hidden outside of the system. With an even large fleet support complex simple observation is not enough tell where supplies are being concentrated- sight blockers cover much of the facility and dummy containers are used for areas that are observable. This lets us having truly massive supply dumps without telegraphing our next move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_8;Fleet Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fleet_support_q_8_desc;The perfection of logistics is not just to supply your soldiers; it is to manipulate your enemies economy so that they provide the supplies you need. While incredibly difficult we've managed to sink up our network with what we can order, letting us benefit from shorter supply lines even as we go deeper into enemy territory. There is a limit to what we can pull without being noticed, but until then we can support larger fleets than anyone had conceived of before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_crew_academy_q_2_desc;Every locale has its own unique properties, from different solar radiation, stress on the engines from the temperature gradients to the correct way to pass through the maze of lagrange points. Learning the tricks of the trade those lets us run our training craft more efficiently, keeping them in service longer while lowering the amount of accidents among the trainees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crew_academy_q_3;Crew Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crew_academy_q_3_desc;Setting up youth organizations that feed directly into the crew program lets us get started earlier and producing higher quality pilots. While we can't give them military models, we can provide access to the training simulations, advice and cockpit setups significantly improving the skills of new recruits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crew_academy_q_4;Crew Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crew_academy_q_4_desc;The experience of aces and condecorated sailors is invaluable and while we have had them come back to teach in the past, this is the first time we've managed to set up a systematic program to maximize the potential of our crews. While it sounds like a lot of marketing jargon, we've figured out the right mix of military service/teaching and how to identify the crewmembers who are better at the latter, letting us get the most out of them without depriving combat squadrons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crew_academy_q_5;Crew Academy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crew_academy_q_5_desc;The best training is combat, but the second best is a high fidelity replica of that. Using captured enemy craft and copies we can insure our pilots have an accurate idea of what they are going up against before they enter combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
