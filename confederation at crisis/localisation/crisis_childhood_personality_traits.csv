EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION0;You feel like you're constantly under intense pressure. You can never seem to think straight, and you never seem to be good enough at anything you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION0;Somebody help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION1;Of late, your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] seems to be growing increasingly anxious, especially around you, terrified that anything [From.GetSheHe] does is wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION1;Maybe I was too hard on [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION10;There's nothing you like more than fresh experiences. You love to explore and experiment, and you drive your teachers mad by listening eagerly to lessons, then wandering off bored during review.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION10;The world is so big!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION10;Hey, want to see this cool new bug I caught?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION11;reacts to your newfound curiosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION11;You [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName] is an inquisitive young [From.GetLadLass]. Just this morning, [From.GetSheHe] showed you some strange insect [From.GetSheHe] found while crawling around the ventilation system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION11;Encourage [From.GetFirstName]'s curiosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION11;Warn [From.GetHerHim] about unexpected dangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION11;Scold [From.GetFirstName] for going off on [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION12;Your [GetFromRelation] grinned when you showed [From.GetHerHim] the fruits of your explorations, and even helped you trace the bug back to its hive in the air vents!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION12;I wonder what else there is to find?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION13;When you told your [GetFromRelation] about the bug you found while exploring the air vents, [From.GetHerHis] face turned pale, and [From.GetSheHe] took you aside and explained to you how dangerous it is to go crawling out of sight like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION13;Curiosity killed the cat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION14;Your [GetFromRelation]'s face turned pale when you told [From.GetHerHim] about how you'd been exploring the air vents. [From.GetSheHeCap] knelt down next to you, and told you how worried [From.GetSheHe] would be if anything happened to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION14;I'm sorry, it won't happen again, I promise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION15;Your [GetFromRelation] just doesn't appreciate the finer things in life. [From.GetSheHeCap] keeps saying that exploring the air vents or running off out of sight is dangerous, but what does [From.GetSheHe] know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION15;I wonder what beer tastes like...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION16;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious when you told [From.GetHerHim] about the bug you'd found exploring the air vents. [From.GetSheHeCap] grounded you for a week and made you promise never to do any such thing again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION16;I guess some things just aren't worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION17;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious when you told [From.GetHerHim] about the bug you'd found exploring the air vents. [From.GetSheHeCap] grounded you for a week and made you promise never to do any such thing again. Later that night, you snuck out of your bedroom anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION17;What does [From.GetSheHe] know, anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION18;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is much more cautious now, and shouldn't run into any more dangerous situations in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION18;Maybe even a little too cautious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION18;At least [From.GetSheHe]'ll be safe from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION19;You thought you'd convinced [From.GetFirstName] of your concerns, but you don't think [From.GetSheHe] really took them to heart. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems more adventurous now than ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION19;What am I ever going to do with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION20;The other children sometimes call you a coward, but you aren't, not really. You're just sensible. Why go looking for trouble? Why try to fix things that aren't broken? Won't you just end up making things worse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION20;I want things to stay just the way they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION20;I don't WANT to go the park, I want to stay home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION21;reacts to your newfound cautiousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION21;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been growing more cautious and conservative lately. Today, when you told [From.GetHerHim] that you were going to the park, you thought [From.GetSheHe]'d be excited, but instead [From.GetSheHe] insisted that [From.GetSheHe] just wanted to stay home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION21;Encourage [From.GetFirstName]'s caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION21;Try to persuade [From.GetFirstName] to take more risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION21;Punish [From.GetFirstName] for [From.GetHerHis] cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION22;You were expecting your [GetFromRelation] to be angry when you refused to go to the park with [From.GetHerHim], but actually, [From.GetSheHe] was quite pleased! [From.GetSheHeCap] appears to approve of your wisdom and caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION22;Safety first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION23;When you refused to go to the park, your [GetFromRelation] knelt down next to you and explained about the importance of trying new things. For the first time, you began to wonder if your caution was letting the world pass you by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION23;Nothing ventured, nothing gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION24;When you refused to go to the park, your [GetFromRelation] knelt down next to you and started talking about how important it was to try new things. It took a while, but you finally begrudgingly agreed that maybe sometimes a little bit of risk was worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION24;It can't be that bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION25;Your [GetFromRelation] is just as bad as the other children! When you refused to go to the park, [From.GetSheHe] started talking about how you should be willing to take risks and try new things, but it's clear that [From.GetSheHe] had no idea what [From.GetSheHe] was talking about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION25;I'm staying right here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION26;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious when you refused to go to the park. [From.GetSheHeCap] practically dragged you from your room and pulled you all the way there. You spent the entire afternoon outside against your will - but in hindsight, it wasn't as bad as you'd feared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION26;Maybe I was just a coward after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION27;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious when you refused to go to the park. [From.GetSheHeCap] practically dragged you from your room and pulled you all the way there. You spent the entire afternoon in grudging misery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION27;This is the worst day of my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION28;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] may not have been too eager to jump into things at first, but [From.GetSheHe] seems more than willing to experiment now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION28;[From.GetSheHeCap] actually seems to enjoy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION28;At least [From.GetSheHe]'s getting some fresh air..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION29;It's no use. No matter what you do, [From.GetFirstName] stubbornly refuses to leave the safety of [From.GetHerHis] quarters. You eventually dragged [From.GetHerHim] down to the park, but [From.GetSheHe] spent the entire cycle fuming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION29;What am I going to do with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION30;You're a model student at school, and you diligently do your chores at home. Some of your friends tease you and call you a teacher's pet, but you're just doing what you're asked to do, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION30;I'm a good [Root.GetLadLass].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION31;reacts to your newfound discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION31;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is a model student, and [From.GetSheHe] always diligently does [From.GetHerHis] chores. You've never seen a more dutiful and responsible child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION31;Reward [From.GetFirstName]'s good behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION31;Try to persuade [From.GetFirstName] to loosen up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION31;Punish [From.GetFirstName] for [From.GetHerHis] brown-nosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION32;Your [GetFromRelation] is exceptionally pleased with your good behavior - this morning, [From.GetSheHe] even bought you a brand new holosuite as a reward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION32;Hard work is the path to success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION33;You were surprised when your [GetFromRelation] came into your room this evening and sat down beside you. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that [From.GetSheHe] was worried about you - that [From.GetSheHe] thought you might be working yourself to hard. [From.GetSheCap] said that [From.GetSheHe] was worried you might burn yourself out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION33;I'm sorry! I promise I'll relax from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION34;Your [GetFromRelation] seemed mostly please with your hard work, but [From.GetSheHe] also seemed a bit worried. [From.GetSheHeCap] explained to you that while hard work is important, so is pacing yourself to make sure you don't burn out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION34;I guess [From.GetSheHe]'s right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION35;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't seem to appreciate your good behavior at all! [From.GetSheHeCap] said that you should take a break and relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION35;Maybe it's some kind of test?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION36;You're so confused! You'd thought you were making your [GetFromRelation] happy, but just this morning, [From.GetSheHe] grounded you for a week! It almost seems like [From.GetSheHe] resents your hard work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION36;This isn't worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION37;You're so confused! You'd thought you were making your [GetFromRelation] happy, but just this morning, [From.GetSheHe] grounded you for a week! Maybe you weren't as well-behaved as you thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION37;I'll have to try harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION38;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is no longer anywhere near as wound up, and seems happy to take things easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION38;Maybe a little too happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION38;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION39;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as rigorous and disciplined as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION39;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION40;Everyone around you seems so uptight. Always running about, always freaking out about such tiny things. Why is it so important that you clean your room right now? You don't mind if it's messy, and you're the one who lives in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION40;I should just take it easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION41;reacts to your newfound carefreeness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION41;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], doesn't seem to have a care in the world. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to spend almost all [From.GetHerHis] time playing or relaxing. Unfortunately, you're having some trouble explaining to [From.GetHerHim] exactly why you need [From.GetHerHim] to clean [From.GetHerHis] room right away, especially when [From.GetSheHe] insists that [From.GetSheHe] LIKES it messy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION41;Well, out of sight, out of mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION41;Offer [From.GetHerHim] a reward for doing [From.GetHerHis] chores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION41;Punish [From.GetFirstName] for failing to do [From.GetHerHis] chores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION42;You think you've finally gotten through to your [GetFromRelation]. It took a long while, but you've finally convinced [From.GetHerHim] to let you take some time off and clean your room later tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION42;Or tomorrow. Or next week. There's no rush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION43;After you refused to clean your room, your [GetFromRelation] did something you hadn't expected - [From.GetSheHe] offered to buy you a new holosuite if you cleaned it. You're not sure your room has ever looked so good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION43;Maybe there's a point to this after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION44;Your [GetFromRelation] offered to start paying you a small allowance in exchange for doing your chores. It's not much, but even so, you think you might finally understand why people would do something they hate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION44;I really want that allowance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION45;Your [GetFromRelation] tried to bribe you into cleaning your room after you refused by offering to pay you a small allowance in exchange for doing your chores, but [From.GetSheHe]'s going to have to do better than that. It's not like there's anything you need money for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION45;There's no way it's worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION46;Your [GetFromRelation] grounded you for a week when you refused to clean your room. Maybe it's time you stopped taking things easy, if only so that never happens again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION46;I'll have to work as hard as I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION47;Your [GetFromRelation] grounded you for a week when you refused to clean your room. That was really mean!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION47;Well, I'll just have to make it EVEN MESSIER.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION48;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is now diligently doing [From.GetHerHis] chores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION48;Maybe a little too diligently...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION48;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION49;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as lazy and carefree as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION49;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION50;There's nothing you like more than going outside and playing with your friends, and nobody has more friends than you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION50;Having lots of friends is the best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION51;reacts to your newfound extraversion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION51;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is extremely outgoing, and has an ever-growing friends. Noisy, distracting-from-[From.GetHerHis]-studies friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION51;Good for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION51;Try to convince [From.GetHerHim] to spend more time on [From.GetHerHis] studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION51;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for wasting so much time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION52;Your [GetFromRelation] is happy to see that you're making friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION52;Hooray!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION53;Your [GetFromRelation] is worried about how much time you're spending with your friends. [From.GetSheHeCap] persuaded you to do more reading and studying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION53;Maybe I don't need that many friends after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION54;Your [GetFromRelation] is worried about how much time you're spending with your friends. [From.GetSheHeCap] asked you to spend more time reading and studying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION54;I guess I could spend some time on that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION55;You really don't understand your [GetFromRelation] sometimes. When [From.GetSheHe] found out that you you were spending so much time with your friends, [From.GetSheHe] tried to tell you to spend more time studying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION55;Why would I want to do THAT?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION56;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious that you were spending so much time playing with your friends instead of studying and put you on a strict curfew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION56;Well, maybe it won't be THAT bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION57;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious that you were spending so much time playing with your friends instead of studying and put you on a strict curfew.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION57;Then I'll just have to start sneaking out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION58;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is now spending more time at home, working on [From.GetHerHis] studies instead of wasting it with [From.GetHerHis] friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION58;But now [From.GetSheHe] won't go outside at ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION58;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION59;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is spending just as much time with [From.GetHerHis] friends - and just as little time on [From.GetHerHis] studies - as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION59;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION60;The other children don't like you very much, but you don't mind. You're happy just staying inside with your datapads and working on your studies instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION60;I love having time to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION61;reacts to your newfound introversion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION61;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is quite shy, and prefers to stay indoors and work on [From.GetHerHis] studies then go out and play with friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION61;Good for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION61;Try to convince [From.GetHerHim] to spend more friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION61;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] anti-social behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION62;Your [GetFromRelation] is happy that you're spending so much time on your studies these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION62;Hooray!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION63;Your [GetFromRelation] is worried about how shy you seem to be, and persuaded you to go out and make new friends. You were actually surprised to see how much fun you were having once you tried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION63;This is pretty nice, actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION64;Your [GetFromRelation] is worried about how shy you seem to be, and persuaded you to go out and play with some of the other children. You were actually surprised to see that it wasn't as bad you thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION64;I think I can live with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION65;Your [GetFromRelation] pulled you out of your room and forced you to spend more time with the other children. It was the worst time you've ever had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION65;I want to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION66;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] took away your hypernet access until you went out and made some new friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION66;Alright, alright, fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION67;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] took away your hypernet access until you went out and made some new friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION67;I can't... I can't do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION68;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is now happily going outside and playing with the other children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION68;Of course, now [From.GetHerHis] studies are suffering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION68;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION69;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is spending just as much time cooped up in [From.GetHerHis] room as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION69;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION70;You've heard that some people find it hard to do things for others, but you don't really understand why. You're always kind, gentle, and polite, and you see no reason to ever stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION70;Kindness is its own reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION71;reacts to your newfound friendliness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION71;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is quite friendly and agreeable - unfailingly polite and always willing to lend a helping hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION71;Good for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION71;Time to explain to [From.GetHerHim] how the real world works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION71;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] spineless behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION72;Your [GetFromRelation] is quite pleased with how friendly and agreeable you have been behaving lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION72;Hooray!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION73;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you tonight and explained how foolish you were being - your friendliness would only make you weak enough for others to exploit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION73;Well, I'm never going to let THAT happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION74;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you tonight and explained that, while your friendliness is admirable, there were bad people in the world who would try to take advantage of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION74;Maybe I should be a bit more careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION75;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you tonight and tried to tell you something, but it made no sense. [From.GetSheHeCap] said you shouldn't be so friendly, that other people would take advantage of you. What does that have to do with anything?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION75;What, do you want me to be mean instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION76;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] actually beat you until you cried for being so "spineless" and "cowardly.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION76;I can't trust [From.GetHerHim]. I can't trust ANYONE.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION77;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] actually beat you until you cried for being so "spineless" and "cowardly." What the hell is wrong with [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION77;I won't let this stop me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION78;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is now showing more of a backbone than [From.GetSheHe] ever has before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION78;Although now [From.GetSheHe]'s started bullying the other children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION78;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION79;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as spineless as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION79;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION80;You're sick and tired of being pushed around. People say that kindness is its own reward, but that's just a lie so that they can take advantage of you. You know better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION80;I need to look out for myself. Nobody else will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION81;reacts to your newfound coldness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION81;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has grown quite cold, even cruel. [From.GetSheHeCap] is uncooperative, and you've even heard that [From.GetSheHe] has been bullying the other children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION81;The [From.GetLadLass] shows spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION81;Persuade [From.GetHerHim] to be kinder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION81;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] misbehavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION82;Your [GetFromRelation] has given [From.GetHerHis] silent approval of your behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION82;At least someone understands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION83;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you tonight and explained to you how your actions were hurting the other children. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that if you wanted others to be kind to you, you needed to be kind to them in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION83;I'm sorry, I had no idea I was hurting them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION84;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you tonight and explained to you how your actions were hurting the other children. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that going looking for fights the way you were would just make more trouble in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION84;I guess [From.GetSheHe] has a point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION85;Your [GetFromRelation] is just as bad as the rest of them. [From.GetSheHeCap] sat down with you tonight and actually gave you the stupid "kindness is its own reward" speech. [From.GetSheHeCap] doesn't care about you anymore than anyone else does!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION85;I can't trust anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION86;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] actually beat you until you cried for your coldness and cruelty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION86;I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll never do it again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION87;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] actually beat you until you cried for your "coldness" and "cruelty." Trying to break you, just like everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION87;I'm not... I'm not afraid of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION88;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is now much more polite and agreeable than [From.GetSheHe] has ever been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION88;In fact, [From.GetSheHe]'s completely spineless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION88;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION89;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as ruthless as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION89;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION90;More and more lately, you find yourself on the observation deck of your guardian's flagship, the [Root.Guardian.GetShipName], staring out at the stars. How could something so beautiful possible run on cold rationality?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION90;There must be something more out there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION91;reacts to your newfound spirituality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION91;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has been spending a lot of time on the [Root.GetShipName]'s observation deck, staring out at the stars. [From.GetSheHeCap] has also started filling [From.GetHerHis] quarters with mystical talismans and other such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION91;Encourage [From.GetHerHis] spirituality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION91;Persuade [From.GetHerHim] to be more rational.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION91;Put an end to this foolishness at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION92;Your [GetFromRelation] seems to be understanding of your quest for deeper knowledge, offering [From.GetHerHis] tacit approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION92;At least someone understands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION93;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you tonight and explained how foolish you were being. A rational explanation, [From.GetSheHe] said, doesn't make the stars any less beautiful, and an irrational one will always have holes. If no answer can satisfy you, then you will never be able to move beyond the question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION93;Maybe that rationality isn't as cold as I thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION94;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you tonight and tried to explain how foolish you were being. To deny a rational explanation, [From.GetSheHe] said, was foolish and shortsighted. Besides, reason only explains the "how" - there is always something greater to explain the "why.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION94;I guess [From.GetSheHe] has a point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION95;Your [GetFromRelation] is just as bad as the rest of them. [From.GetSheHeCap] and gave you one of those close-minded speeches about how only scientific methods could find the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION95;Small-minded fascist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION96;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] broke into your room, tore down your talismans, and demanded that you abandon this nonsense immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION96;Alright, alright, I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION97;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] broke into your room, tore down your talismans, and demanded that you abandon this "nonsense" immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION97;Sure, I'll do that. Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION98;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is now far more rational and no longer mired in superstitition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION98;Quite rational, in fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION98;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION99;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as obsessed with [From.GetHerHis] mystical mumbo-jumbo as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION99;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION100;More and more lately, you find yourself on the observation deck of your guardian's flagship, the [Root.Guardian.GetShipName], staring out at the stars. It amazes you to think about how something so beautiful emerges from the simple laws of gravity and nuclear physics. You can't imagine why some people try to deceive themselves about the mathematical elegance that lies behind the universe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION100;There's nothing "mere" about the physical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION101;reacts to your newfound skepticism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION101;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has been spending a lot of time looking through scientific textbooks and stargazing. [From.GetSheHeCap] also got into an argument last night with one of your more superstitious guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION101;What a smart little [From.GetLadLass].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION101;Ask [From.GetHerHim] to be more considerate of others' views.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION101;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] lack of faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION102;Last night, you got into an argument with one of your [GetFromRelation]'s important guests. It wasn't your fault, the [From.GetWomanMan] just believed such incredibly foolish things! Fortunately, your [GetFromRelation] saw the correctness of your point of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION102;It's nice to have some intelligent conversation for once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION103;Last night, you got into an argument with one of your [GetFromRelation]'s important guests. It wasn't your fault, the [From.GetWomanMan] just believed such incredibly foolish things. After [From.GetSheHe] left, however, your [GetFromRelation] sat down next to you and tried to explain to you the deeper meanings of [From.GetHerHis] guest's philosophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION103;Perhaps there's more to this than I thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION104;Last night, you got into an argument with one of your [GetFromRelation]'s important guests. It wasn't your fault, the [From.GetWomanMan] just believed such incredibly foolish things. After [From.GetSheHe] left, however, your [GetFromRelation] sat down next to you and asked you to be more accepting of others' points of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION104;Maybe I should just be less confrontational about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION105;Last night, you got into an argument with one of your [GetFromRelation]'s important guests. It wasn't your fault, the [From.GetWomanMan] just believed such incredibly foolish things. After [From.GetSheHe] left, however, your [GetFromRelation] sat down next to you and tried to get you to be more accepting of others' stupidity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION105;No. They're wrong, and I'm not going to lie about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION106;Last night, you got into an argument with one of your [GetFromRelation]'s important guests. It wasn't your fault, the [From.GetWomanMan] just believed such incredibly foolish things. Your [GetFromRelation] was furious, immediately dismissing you from the table and later grounding you for a week. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to find your lack of faith disturbing, on a deeply personal level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION106;Alright, alright, I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION107;Last night, you got into an argument with one of your [GetFromRelation]'s important guests. It wasn't your fault, the [From.GetWomanMan] just believed such incredibly foolish things. Your [GetFromRelation] was furious, immediately dismissing you from the table and later grounding you for a week. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to find your lack of faith disturbing, on a deeply personal level.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION107;The hell does [From.GetSheHe] know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION108;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] has abandoned [From.GetHerHis] skepticism, or at least is being more polite about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION108;Although I'm not sure these new superstitions are an improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION108;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION109;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as coldly rational, and just as confrontational about it, as ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION109;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION130;Some people feel the need to lie - not just to the people around them, but to themselves. You're not like that. You find it so much easier to just be honest and humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION130;Besides, arrogances is kind of annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION131;reacts to your newfound honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION131;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has become a very honest and humble young [From.GetWomanMan].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION131;Good for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION131;Convince [From.GetHerHim] to show more pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION131;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for the shame [From.GetSheHe] brings on the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION132;Your [GetFromRelation] is quite pleased with your honesty and modesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION132;Thank you, [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION133;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you in your quarters and convinced you of the importance of taking pride and standing up for yourself, and not letting minor details get in your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION133;The truth is what you make of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION134;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you in your quarters and talked to you about all the things you have to be proud of. You're starting to feel a bit silly about your modesty now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION134;Maybe it's okay for me to sell myself a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION135;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you in your quarters and talked to you about all the things [From.GetSheHe] thought you had to be proud of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION135;Well, yeah, of course [From.GetSheHe]'d say that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION136;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you 'bringing shame upon your family' and has locked you in your quarters until further notice. [From.GetSheHeCap] demands you start showing pride appropriate to your station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION136;Alright, I'm sorry, I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION137;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you 'bringing shame upon your family' and has locked you in your quarters until further notice. [From.GetSheHeCap] demands you start showing pride appropriate to your station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION137;Getting locked in my room isn't much to be proud of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION138;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] has abandoned [From.GetHerHis] honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION138;In fact, [From.GetSheHe]'s rather arrogant now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION138;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION139;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as honest and modest as ever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION139;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION140;The world belongs to the people who can sell themselves. Why handicap yourself by hiding your strong points and letting people see your weak ones? People should see you the way you want to be seen, not the way you really are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION140;I'm not going to hide how great I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION141;reacts to your newfound pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION141;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has become a very boastful young [From.GetWomanMan]  - one who is, perhaps, economical with the truth when it comes to selling [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION141;As [From.GetSheHe] should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION141;Talk to [From.GetHerHim] about honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION141;Humiliate [From.GetHerHim] in front of [From.GetHerHis] friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION142;Your [GetFromRelation] is quite pleased with the pride you show in yourself and the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION142;Well, of course [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION143;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you in your quarters and talked to you about the foolishness of your arrogance. Lying to yourself isn't going to help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION143;You're right, I'm sorry. I'll never do that again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION144;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you in your quarters and talked to you about the foolishness of your arrogance. You're not sure [From.GetSheHe]'s convinced you of all the virtues of modesty, but it might help to have a more realistic assessment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION144;Pride comes before a fall, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION145;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you in your quarters and tried to talk you into being more humble and "honest".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION145;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s just jealous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION146;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious with your arrogance, and decided to teach you some modesty by dropping you off at a friend's party in nothing but your underwear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION146;Alright, I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION147;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious with your arrogance, and decided to teach you some modesty by dropping you off at a friend's party in nothing but your underwear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION147;You think this is going to break me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION148;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] has abandoned [From.GetHerHis] arrogance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION148;[From.GetSheHeCap] seems to cringe when I even bring it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION148;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION149;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as arrogant as ever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION149;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION150;You have so much already, while others have so little. Why bother striving for more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION150;I'm happy with what I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION151;reacts to your newfound contentment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION151;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], seems to be fully content with [From.GetHerHis] lot in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION151;As [From.GetSheHe] should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION151;Persuade [From.GetHerHim] to be more ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION151;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] lack of ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION152;Your [GetFromRelation] is pleased to see that you are grateful for what you have and content with your lot in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION152;Well, of course [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION153;Your [GetFromRelation] is disappointed in how unambitious you've been acting. [From.GetSheHeCap] told you that you were meant to do great things, and it was only your lack of will that was holding you back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION153;I'm capable of so much more than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION154;Your [GetFromRelation] is disappointed in how unambitious you've been acting. [From.GetSheHeCap] convinced you that while you might think things are fine enough as it is, that's no excuse to rest on your laurels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION154;I need to do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION155;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't understand your attitude. [From.GetSheHeCap] is deluding [From.GetHerselfHimself], trying to convince you that what you have isn't enough, that you deserve more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION155;[GetFromRelation]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION156;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] declared that a member of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family should NEVER settle for second-best, and declared that you were confined to quarters until you were able to best your classmates in every respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION156;Alright, I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION157;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] declared that a member of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family should NEVER settle for second-best, and declared that you were confined to quarters until you were able to best your classmates in every respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION157;I can deal with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION158;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] has abandoned [From.GetHerHis] contented attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION158;In fact, [From.GetSheHe]'s striving for more than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION158;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION159;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as contented and laid back as ever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION159;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION160;You are never satisfied with what you have. You alwasy feel the need for more, to reach ever forward for greatness. The idea of settling for mediocrity repulses you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION160;Apathy is death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION161;reacts to your newfound ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION161;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is an extremely ambitious young [From.GetLadLass], reaching for the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION161;As [From.GetSheHe] should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION161;Persuade [From.GetHerHim] to be happy with what [From.GetSheHe] has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION161;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] presumptuousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION162;Your [GetFromRelation] is pleased to see that you are so active and ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION162;Well, of course [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION163;Your [GetFromRelation] is displeased with your ambition, and took you aside to have a long talk about the importance of being grateful for what you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION163;I'm sorry, I never realized...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION164;Your [GetFromRelation] is displeased with your ambition, and took you aside to have a long talk about the importance of being grateful for what you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION164;Maybe I don't need to be THAT ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION165;Your [GetFromRelation] just doesn't understand. [From.GetSheHeCap] tried to talk you into become just some mindless, contented drone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION165;What does [From.GetSheHe] know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION166;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] threatened to abandon you on the streets if you didn't stop reaching above your station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION166;Alright, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION167;Your [GetFromRelation] is afraid of you. [From.GetSheHeCap] threatened to abandon you on the streets if you didn't stop reaching above your station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION167;I'm calling that bluff..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION168;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] has abandoned [From.GetHerHis] ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION168;[From.GetSheHeCap] seems almost lazy now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION168;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION169;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as ambitious as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION169;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION170;Of all your friends, you are the most courageous, always the first to rush into danger. You can't help but love the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of your life being on the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION170;I fear nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION171;reacts to your newfound courage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION171;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is an extremely brave and courageous young [From.GetLadLass].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION171;As [From.GetSheHe] should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION171;I'll soon fix THAT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION172;Your [GetFromRelation] is pleased with your courage and bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION172;Well, of course [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION176;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you, and you have no idea why. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to punish you at random, for inexplicable and nonsensical reasons, almost as if [From.GetHerHis] only goal is to instill a deep pit of terror in your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION176;Please, just stop, whatever I did, I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION177;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you, and you have no idea why. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to punish you at random, for inexplicable and nonsensical reasons, almost as if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to break your spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION177;And I fear YOU least of all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION178;You subjected your [GetFromRelation] to a harsh regime of gaslighting and inexplicable, unpredictable punishments, carried out at random. The treatment seems to have worked, as [From.GetSheHe] now cringes in terror at the mere sight of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION178;I really hope that was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION178;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION179;You subjected [From.GetFirstName] to a harsh regime of gaslighting and inexplicable, unpredictable punishments, carried out at random. Unfortunately for you, [From.GetSheHe] seems to be able to resist even your strongest efforts to break [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION179;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION180;So what if you cringe at the very idea of danger? So what if you still can't sleep with the lights out? That doesn't make you a coward, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION180;I'm not a coward. I'm not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION181;reacts to your cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION181;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is a frightful young [From.GetWomanMan]. You just found out that [From.GetSheHe] still needs to have the lights on to go to sleep, even at [From.GetHerHis] age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION181;There's nothing I can do about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION181;Show [From.GetHerHim] how to be brave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION181;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] insipid weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION182;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't seem to be able to do much to help you with your fears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION182;At least [From.GetSheHe]'s not making it any worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION183;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you last night and talked to you about your fears. [From.GetSheHeCap] explained that courage wasn't the absence of fear, but the ability to overcome it. You slept with the lights on again last night, but now you understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION183;That isn't really what courage is about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION184;Your [GetFromRelation] sat down with you last night and talked to you about your fears. [From.GetSheHeCap] taught you some ways to help soothe your nerves at night, and to at least have something of a steady head in a frightening situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION184;I can deal with this..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION185;sat down with you last night and talked to you about your fears, but nothing [From.GetSheHe] did seemed to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION185;There's nothing I can do to make this go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION186;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] has started actively forcing you into dangerous situations in an attempt to get you to overcome your fears. You're not sure it's working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION186;I can put on a brave face, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION187;Your [GetFromRelation] is furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] has started actively forcing you into dangerous situations in an attempt to get you to overcome your fears. You're pretty sure it's not working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION187;WHY DID YOU THINK THIS WOULD HELP?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION188;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] has managed to overcome the worst of [From.GetHerHis] fears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION188;In fact, [From.GetSheHe] has become quite brave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION188;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION189;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as cowardly as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION189;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION200;You've always been taught to be a good [Root.Religion.GetName], but lately, your guardian has been telling you about the importance of [Root.Guardian.Religion.GetName] philosophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION200;I'd like to know more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION201;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has becoming convinced of the importance of [Root.Religion.GetName] principles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION201;A very bright [From.GetLadLass].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION301;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has begun adopting [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] culture and mannerisms thanks to your influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION400;You've lately become a lot more interested in [Root.Religion.GetName] political causes. Last week, you attended a major political rally in the [Root.Location.GetName] System.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION400;Down with this sort of thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION401;reacts to your newfound radical politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION401;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has gotten [From.GetHerselfHimself] involved in radical politics. You just found out that last week, [From.GetSheHe] attended a [From.Religion.GetName] political rally in the [From.Location.GetName] System.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION401;The [From.GetLadLass] shows spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION401;Persuade [From.GetHerHim] to temper [From.GetHerHis] eagerness with wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION401;Convince [From.GetHerHim] that it's more important to look out for [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDCHILDHOODEDUCATION401;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] disgraceful behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION402;Your [GetFromRelation] is quite pleased with your new engagement in politics and has been quietly encouraging you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION402;It's good to know [From.GetSheHe] understands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION403;Your [GetFromRelation] heard about the political rally you attended, and came to your quarters to discuss it with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] convinced you that your radical politics would only lead you to misunderstand others and would ultimately do more harm than good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION403;Perhaps the world isn't that black and white.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION404;Your [GetFromRelation] heard about the political rally you attended, and came to your quarters to discuss it with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] convinced you that your enthusiasm was admirable, but that it needed to be tempered with wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION404;I wouldn't want to just make our problems bigger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION405;Your [GetFromRelation] heard about the political rally you attended, and came to your quarters to discuss it with you. You weren't sure what you expected, but you weren't really surprised when [From.GetSheHe] tried to talk you into being another mindless drone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION405;I know what's right, and I won't be silent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION406;Your [GetFromRelation] heard about the political rally you attended, and came to your quarters to discuss it with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] convinced you that you were being naive, and that in the real world it was more important to look out for your own interests first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION406;Well, now I feel embarassed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION407;Your [GetFromRelation] heard about the political rally you attended, and came to your quarters to discuss it with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] convinced you that it was important not to let yourself be so easily taken advantage of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION407;Well, now I feel embarassed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION409;Your [GetFromRelation] heard about the political rally you attended, and [From.GetSheHe] is absolutely livid. [From.GetSheHeCap] confined you to your quarters for the next three months and insisted that in the future, you not engage in such behavior unbecoming of a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION409;...isn't this exactly what we wanted to do to other people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION410;I guess this is what I get for trying to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION411;What the hell does [From.GetSheHe] know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION412;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] has abandoned [From.GetHerHis] radical politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION412;[From.GetSheHeCap] seems more understanding of others' perspectives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION412;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION413;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as stubbornly insistent on [From.GetHerHis] radical politics as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION413;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION414;...and is now completely self-interested instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION420;Your classmates have been fighting each other over differences in politics. You know better than that, and you've been trying to stay neutral and keep the peace among the various factions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION420;Someone has to, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION421;reacts to your newfound moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION421;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has started showing an active disdain for radical politics. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to prefer a more moderate, conciliatory approach, trying to understand different perspectives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION421;It's rare to see such wisdom in one so young.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION421;Persuade [From.GetHerHim] to have more conviction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION421;Try to convince [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetHerHis] own self-interest is more important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDCHILDHOODEDUCATION421;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] softness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION422;Your [GetFromRelation] is apparently pleased with your newfound approach to politics, and has been quietly encouraging you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION422;It's good to know [From.GetSheHe] understands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION423;Last night, you got into a conversation about politics with your [GetFromRelation]. To your surprise, [From.GetSheHe] made an excellent case that the [Root.Religion.GetName] was perhaps more important than you were giving it credit for.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION423;Perhaps sometimes things ARE black and white.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION424;Last night, you got into a conversation about politics with your [GetFromRelation]. To your surprise, [From.GetSheHe] made an excellent case that while your commitment to peace is commendable, sometimes it's important to take decisive action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION424;Everything in moderation, even moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION425;Last night, you got into a conversation about politics with your [GetFromRelation]. [From.GetSheHeCap] tried to convince you that it was wrong of you to be too understanding of others' points of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION425;Shows what [From.GetSheHe] knows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION426;Last night, you got into a conversation about politics with your [GetFromRelation]. [From.GetSheHeCap] convinced you that you were being naive, and that in the real world it was more important to look out for your own interests first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION427;Well, now I feel embarassed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION429;Your [GetFromRelation] is absolutely livid with you, accusing you of being "soft". [From.GetSheHeCap] has had you confined to quarters until you start "showing some backbone".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION429;I'll show [From.GetHerHim] "backbone".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION430;I guess this is what I get for trying to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION431;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s just proving me right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION432;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] has abandoned [From.GetHerHis] moderate politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION432;If anything, [From.GetSheHe] has a tendency towards fanatacism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION432;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION433;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as stubbornly insistent on [From.GetHerHis] moderate politics as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION433;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION434;...and is now completely self-interested instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION440;Your classmates have started showing an interest in politics, but you know better - what's important is looking out for your own self-interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION440;Nobody else will look out for me, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION441;reacts to your newfound amorality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION441;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has started showing a cynical disdain for political causes of all stripes. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to only care about [From.GetHerHis] own self-interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION441;Well, [From.GetSheHe]'s right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION441;Convince [From.GetHerHim] to believe in something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION441;Try to convince [From.GetHerHim] to see things from others' point of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDCHILDHOODEDUCATION441;Punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] selfishness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION442;Your [GetFromRelation] is apparently pleased with your newfound practicality, and has been quietly encouraging you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION442;It's good to know [From.GetSheHe] understands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION443;Your [GetFromRelation] is apparently concerned by your behavior. [From.GetSheHeCap] had a long discussion with you, and to your surprise, made several good points that convinced you of the righteousness of the [Root.Religion.GetName] cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION443;Some things are worth fighting for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION444;Your [GetFromRelation] is apparently concerned by your behavior. [From.GetSheHeCap] had a long discussion with you, and to your surprise, managed to convince you that perhaps the [Root.Religion.GetName] cause wasn't quite as worthless as you'd thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION444;Maybe it's NOT all about me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION445;Your [GetFromRelation] is apparently concerned by your behavior. [From.GetSheHeCap] tried to convince you to put others' interests before your own, like some kind of idiot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION445;Shows what [From.GetSheHe] knows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION446;Your [GetFromRelation] is apparently concerned by your behavior. [From.GetSheHeCap] sat down and talked to you about it, and to your surprise, managed to convince you of the importance of seeing things from others' point of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION446;Maybe it's important to do the right thing after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION447;Your [GetFromRelation] is apparently concerned by your behavior. [From.GetSheHeCap] sat down and talked to you about it, and managed to convince you that perhaps other people had more value than you thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION447;Perhaps it's okay to put others first sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION449;You don't think you've ever seen your [GetFromRelation] so furious with you. [From.GetSheHeCap] is determined to "correct" your behavior by any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION449;Fine, fine, I'll be a good little soldier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION450;Is this how I'VE been treating people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION451;Well, [From.GetSheHe] can go to hell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
