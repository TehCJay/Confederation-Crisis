terran_federalist_DESC;"§Y"Above all, we recognize this - that all men are brothers and all women sisters, the sons and daughters of Earth."\n - Fourth Treaty of Terra, 2489§!\n\nThe Federalist Party was one of the two primary political parties of the Terran Confederation throughout most of its history. Terran Federalists support the ideal of a single, united human state, a democratic federation with its capital on Earth.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

terran_republican_DESC;"§Y"The most stringent cries for freedom are always those of the slavers and warlords."\n - President Morgan Afolayan, 2998§!\n\nThe Republican Party was one of the two primary political parties of the Terran Confederation throughout most of its history. Terran Republicans support the ideal of a highly centralized, democratic, united republic governing all humanity, with its capital on Earth.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

terran_imperial_DESC;"§Y"It takes a peculiar sort of mind to witness the horrors of the Crisis and still say, 'Yes, democracy will be our salvation.'"\n - Captain-General Luo Tao, 3007§!\n\nThe disasters of the late 30th century caused many Terrans to lose their faith in democracy. Terran Imperialists seek to unite humanity under the rule of a strong, authoritarian government centered on Earth.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

colonial_separatist_DESC;"§Y"We are indeed the children of Earth. But all children must one day learn to stand on their own."\n - Governor-General Juan Lebedev, 2997§!\n\nColonial Separatists believe that the notion of a single pan-human government is inherently flawed, and that Earth's colonies should be allowed to seek their own futures. They support free and independent democracies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

neo_feudal_DESC;"§Y"It is no coincidence that the archetypical hero is the knight in shining armor."\n - Duke Joseph Blackburne, 2999§!\n\nNeo-Feudalists are a diverse lot. Some believe that the failures of the Confederation have proved that the Enlightenment itself was a mistake. Others simply prefer the romance of feudal titles to stark military ranks. Either way, they support independent and decentralized but autocratic governments.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

astrist_DESC;"§Y"Up there, someone on your crew says something, you don't ask questions. You do it, because they're on your crew. No exceptions."\n - Captain Michael McKinley, 2183§!\n\nThe Astrist movement began when the first great wave of space explorers returned to Earth and found themselves unable to integrate with ordinary life. Astrists support the imposition of spacer values - loyalty to your crew, honesty and integrity in your dealings with others, responsibility to your subordinates and absolute and unquestioning obedience to your superiors - over everyday life. They support highly centralized autocratic dictatorships, but possess a distaste for Terrans in particular.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

neo_socialist_DESC;"§Y"We have conquered gravity. We have conquered the stars. Is it really so impossible that we might conquer human greed?"\n - Director-General Ekateirna Leonidov, 2549§!\n\nWhen Russia first began settling the Centauri Reach, many Russian communists fled Earth for the one place not yet corrupted by capitalism: space. Neo-socialists the modern heirs to the various socialist and Communist movements of the 20th century. In theory, they support democracy and autonomy, but they are often willing to sacrifice these things in the name of the greater good.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

pilgrim_DESC;"§Y"This is, of course, space travel - and in any discussion of religion, it deserves to be written thus: SPACE TRAVEL!"\n - Frank Herbert, 1965§!\n\nWhile humanity follows many different religions, nearly all of them share one vital commonality - they all originated on Old Earth. Across the galaxy are billions of colonists who find themselves compelled to travel to the holy places on Earth, and over time, an infrastructure has evolved to support them. The largest organization responsible for the transportation of pilgrims is known simply as "the Pilgrimage."";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orthodox_DESC;"§Y"We once believed that our exile from Eden was eternal. How foolish we were, not to realize that it still surrounded us, and that in His mercy, God welcomes all who are willing to return."\n - The Edict of Reformation§!\n\nFollowing the Edict of Reformation, the Pilgrimage transformed from a loose association of clerics into a true, united church. While the actual beliefs of followers of the Church of Holy Terra can very wildly, they all share a common veneration of humanity's homeworld and hold it as sacred.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
solar_cultist;Solar Cultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
solar_cultist_DESC;"The "Solar Cult" is actually a family of sects within the Pilgrimage, dating back several hundred years, who have turned from merely venerating Earth to actively worshipping it, and in particular the life-giving force of the Celestial Sun. Modelling themselves on the ancient Mithraic Mysteries, they are regarded as being unusually secretive and a bit eccentric by more orthodox Pilgrims.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

solarian_DESC;The Church of the Unconquered Sun was born from a family of sects within the Pilgrimage who had turned from merely venerating Earth to actively worshipping both it and the Sun itself. Modelling itself on the Mithraic mystery cults of Imperial Rome, the Solarian church is a secretive and mystical order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
xenoterran;Xenoterran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
xenoterran_DESC;"§Y"Out of all the countless worlds of humanity, it seems a convenient coincidence that the oldest and most worthy of respect would also be the most powerful and prideful."\n - Abbot Jie Xu, 2989§!\n\nWhile nearly all religions venerate Earth as the Sacred World and the birthplace of humanity, there are those who refuse to acknowledge this fact. "Xenoterran" theology posits that humanity was created on some other world, and that the primacy of Earth is therefore completely unmerited.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

adoptionist_cultist_DESC;"§Y"The Gods made four suns before ours. It is inconceivable arrogance to think that they would never make a sixth."\n - Zyanya Macehualli, 2256§!\n\nAdoptionist theology is shared by a number of sects within the Pilgrimage, most notably the Nahui-Ahtle movement";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adoptionist;Adoptionist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imperial_cult;Imperial Cultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imperial_cult_DESC;Imperial cult is a generic term for any religion that engages in literal worship of their head of state.

cyberneticist_DESC;"§Y"Where does it end? It doesn't. Why should it? Life is good, health is good, beauty and happiness and fun and laughter and challenge and learning are good. This does not change for arbitrarily large amounts of life and beauty."\n - Eliezer Yudkowsky, 2007§!\n\nCyberneticists seek to transcend the limitations of their humanity by using cybernetics to become something greater than themselves.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
machine_cultist;Machine Cultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
machine_cultist_DESC;"§Y"The history of the universe progresses from the small and simple to the great and complex. God cannot have come before us. God must be that which comes after us."\n - Doctor Nishi Eremias, 2992§!\n\nOften derogatorily referred to as "Toaster Worshippers," the Machine Cult are a strange Cyberneticist sect who seem to regard the mechanical with outright religious reverence. They believe that the flesh is a physical manifestation of sin, and seek to convert as much of themselves as possible to metal.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hiver;Hiver;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hiver_DESC;"§Y"Resistance is futile."\n - Patrick Stewart, 1990§!\n\nThe Hive is a wonder of modern engineering. By integrating a DNI implant into an ansible wireless network, it is possible to directly join your mind with hundreds of billions of others, allowing you to call instantly upon the sum knowledge of humanity. And when has hearing voices in your head ever been a bad sign?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bio_directionist;Bio-Directionist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bio_directionist_DESC;"§Y"The great problem with benevolent despotism was the notorious mortality of despots."\n - Victoria Locksley, 2505§!\n\nThe Bio-Directionists are the modern-day philosophical descendants of the early twentieth century Eugenicists, although they themselves would deny any such connection fiercely. Rather than directing human evolution by means of forced sterilization and genocide, they seek to improve the human genome through more humane means: cloning and genetic engineering.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
