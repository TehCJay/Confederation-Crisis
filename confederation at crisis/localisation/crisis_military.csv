You stumble forward as a lance of ionized titanium plasma strikes directly behind you, vaporizing an area the size of a city block down to a depth of five kilometers. It takes you a moment to realize that you're still breathing. You've lost a leg, but you're alive. Barely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Aboard [From.GetHerHis] flagship, [From.GetCrisisBestName] looks down upon the homeworld, and feels the weight of history upon [From.GetHerHis] shoulders.\n\nWhy did [From.GetSheHe] give the order? None but [From.GetSheHe] can say. But in that one terrible instant, the heavens made their will known, and the homeworld of humanity burned.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBATTLE0;Laser light reflects off particle beam tracers, illuminating the cockpit of your fighter. An enemy ace is on your tail, and your squadron is out of position. You swoop between two friendly ships, and for a moment you think you've lost your pursuer - until the laser slices directly through your cockpit, perilously close to your face. It's all you can do to eject in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBATTLE1;has shot you down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE1;Laser light reflects off particle beam tracers in the dark skies of [Root.Location.GetName]. You gun your main thrusters as you pursue an enemy fighter pilot, janking and veering to try to avoid you. [From.GetSheHeCap] tries to evade you by flying between two friendly ships, but you are easily able to cut [From.GetHerHim] off and deliver a laser blast straight through [From.GetHerHis] cockpit. [From.GetSheHeCap] ejects, leaving the fighter to spin away, a trail of leaking shock gel in its wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE2;The situation looks grim. You took a nasty hit earlier, and your dorsal maneuvering thruster is barely functional. An enemy ace is hot on your tail, and it's all you can do to avoid being shot down. Alarms flash. The portside fuel tank is on fire. You need to eject. You need to eject NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE3;You have [From.GetFullName] directly in your sights. [From.GetHerHisCap] fighter has taken one too many hits already, and you're never one to pass up an opportunity. A quick squeeze of the trigger, and a beam of light lances out, straight through [From.GetHerHis] portside fuel tank. [From.GetSheHeCap] ejects, mere seconds before [From.GetHerHis] ship explodes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE4;It's not looking good. You've lost two maneuvering thrusters, your guidance system is offline, an an enemy ace is hot on your tail. You can still get out of this, though, right? There has to be something you can do. If you can just...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBATTLE1;has killed you in battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE5;You have [From.GetFullName] dead in your sights. [From.GetHerHisCap] fighter is already badly damaged, and [From.GetSheHe] doesn't have the maneuverability to escape you. It's almost a shame, when you deliver the final beam directly into [From.GetHerHis] engine. Almost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE10;Your squadron rejoins you in formation, as you prepare for a second run on the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. You gun the throttle and soar towards it, as point-defense lasers light up the night. One manages to graze your cockpit. It's not fatal, but you're leaking shock gel, orange fluid spraying into the sky behind you. Another laser forces you to pull a few Gs too many, and a few seconds later, the world goes black.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBATTLE11;has shot you down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE11;You pace the bridge of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], watching as an enemy fighter squadron lines up for another run. Your point defense lasers light up the night, tearing through their hulls and leaving shock gel, fuel, and twisted metal tumbling through space. A few fighters make it through the barrage, but their pilots will no doubt soon fall victim to G-force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE12;Your attack run on the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] has failed. Your squadron is scattered - those who aren't dead - and the warship's point defense dances in the sky around you. You twist and veer, but despite your best efforts, one beam lances through your portside maneuvering thruster during a particularly dangerous turn, sending you spiraling out of control. You manage to eject - but only moments before your fighter explodes against the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]'s hull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE13;You lean over the tactical holotank, watching as the latest fighter attack on the [FromFrom.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] falls apart. You can't help but grin as the squadron leader's fighter crashes into her hull, exploding harmlessly against her armor. One more cocky fighter pilot neutralized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE14;You had been told that the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]'s point defense was down. You had been told wrong. You never really had a chance, you supposed. Your squadron attempted their bombing run, of course, but the glittering beams sliced them apart with callous ease. You weren't going to make it. That, at least, was clear. All you could do, as the beams closed in on you, was close your eyes, and wait for the end to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBATTLE15;has killed you in battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE15;Yet another foolish fighter assault on the [FromFrom.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] meets its end, as your point defense slices through them. Twisted chunks of metal tumble through space, and you are greeted to a macabre sight as the corpse of an enemy pilot collides with one of the external cameras before slipping away into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE20;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], incoming fire from the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]! You are about to wave a hand to dismiss the report, when the [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] lurches to the side.

EVTDESCBATTLE21;"You savor the moment as a salvo of missiles burst forth, filling the sky with tailfire as they twist and converge upon the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. There's something viscerally thrilling about seeing the fires light up across her surface as your hammer comes down upon her. "Multiple hull breaches, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]," your tactical officer reports, "she's taking on vaccuum."";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABATTLE21;Excellent work, Guns. Reload and continue fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE22;You've been engaged in melee with the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] for some time now, trading missile and laser barrages amidst the twisting chaos of battle.

EVTDESCBATTLE32;"Fires on decks three through five! your first officer shouts into the comm, "Damage control, do you copy?" The bridge is in chaos.

EVTOPTABATTLE32;Oh, of course, right on schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE33;The [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] is taking on vaccuum. Three of her decks are on fire, geysers of ignited oxygen spewing into space. And her main fuel tank is exposed. A torpedo in the right place would be all it took to take her out of the fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABATTLE33;All wings, form on me! We're going after the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBATTLE34;The [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] groans as her hull buckles under the strain of battle. In the glittering lights of the holotank, you can see half of her hull simply falling away. You can HEAR half of her hull simply falling away. The bridge is exposed. And a squadron of bombers is coming right for you. What the hell are your point defense guns doing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBATTLE35;The [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] has come under heavy fire, and as you watch, you can see half her hull simply fall away, crew being pulled out into vaccuum as decks are exposed. Even the bridge, nestled safely at her heart, is now tantalizingly close to the surface.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABATTLE35;All wings, form on me! We're going after the [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
