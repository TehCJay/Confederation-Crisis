EVTTITLENARRATIVE1;The Crisis of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE1;An economic golden age grinds toward standstill. The previously inexorable march of imperialistic progress has been stamped out, stalled, or cut at the stem within the civil reaches of space. Even now, pretenders and rival ideologies march to war against our colonial masters, threatening mankind's ascendancy among the stars. Entire systems answer the rally to arms, each for their own benefit, bent on imposing will onto the masses just as the father did unto them.\n\nIn the time of the old guard, corporate entities acted with impunity. Their influence within government was unmatched, able to bend the rule of law at a whim in the name of a bottom line. It was not unheard of during this age to hear of corporate shock troopers and inter-corporate rivalries that put entire systems in danger. And amidst this chaos, sedition ran wild throughout mankind's stellar holdings. Opportunists and revolutionaries bided their time, and rose nearly as one to overthrow the negligent and indifferent oppressors.\n\nSome call this the end, a glimpse into a war-stricken future where every man declares autonomy in the name of unproven doctrines and belief without foundation. Others know it as righteous justice, for the old guard had known their burgeoning share of scandal and abuse of power.\n\n\nYou know it as the Crisis of the Confederation..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENARRATIVE3;Death of Grand Admiral Wei;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE3;To be written. For now, this serves as a way to tell the player that yes, Wei dying out of nowhere is intentional if you aren't playing as him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANARRATIVE3;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENARRATIVE100;The Coalition Triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE100;Glory to the many, the oppressors overcome!\n\nTogether they have stood, these breakaway heroes and vandals, against a common tyranny. And though they may not agree on the length of the hour, the strength of a soul, or the distribution of a toothbrush, most have cast aside their colonial masters so that they might engineer new fates. In this time of uncertainty and disarray, the galaxy waits with bated breath as political power levels and vacuums become filled. This peace, hard fought, ushers in new challenges in every stata of society across the civil galaxy.\n\nFor now, we have much to look forward to on harvest day, during tax season, and whilst floating idly through the sea of stars. Every meal shared with family and every listless stare can be savored sweetly, knowing that justice had prevailed even in the deep unknown. With our freedom comes realization, as we may never turn back the clock.\n\nAnd through it all, some sense of unease lingers still. Where will we go from here? Can we truly be our own keepers in this hollow dark?\n\n\nOnly time will tell..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANARRATIVE100;Damn uppity Colonials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBNARRATIVE100;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCNARRATIVE100;Hope they don't crack down now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDNARRATIVE100;Thank God it's over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENARRATIVE101;An Uneasy Stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE101;The conflict is over, for now.\n\nAll partied with independence have fought valiantly in the depths of space and on the ground, casting off yokes wherever they could. And though they fought valiantly, not all will share this new and uncertain peace. The Confederation is shorn, with a treaty hammered out to mark a simplistic ceasefire with these new states. And though some do celebrate, they do so with trepidation. How long until the Confederation strikes out, bent on a lawful reclamation of old territories?\n\nWithout the Military State of Jion and the Directorate of Tarka, independence becomes that much harder to maintain. And though few will weep for these military juntas and callous dictatorships, their vessels had proved valuable to the war effort.\n\n\nThe length of the peace it anyone's game. But conflict is inevitable, and all know this in their heart of hearts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANARRATIVE101;It could be worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBNARRATIVE101;One day we shall all be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCNARRATIVE101;Hope they don't crack down now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDNARRATIVE101;Thank God it's over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENARRATIVE102;Victory Parade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE102;All is well, from rim to core!\n\nRebels and raiders, opportunists and pretenders had raised their flag against the great nation that is the Confederacy. Now, loyalist boots march over most worlds in civil space, bringing with them the law and order so bravely afforded to them by centuries of progress on our shared cradle world. With a house in order, mankind can look forward with singular purpose and vision between shared stars and worlds of plenty. A universe led by the legal distribution of power, and the mediation of strong and longsighted rule.\n\nThe President had this to say.\n"We each look out and see the stars, right there for the taking, for the material betterment of all. But some of us looked down, looked across to our shared family and thought to themselves that this was their moment to cause chaos and panic. They assumed that if our foundation were badly shaken, we would topple like so many blocks. But I am proud to announce that they proved our inalienable right to the cosmos! Rather than bend, and eventually break, we held fast against envy, greed, and ultimate dissolution. We proved the strength of our core beyond a doubt, that we are capable of so much more than petty grievances and make-belief."\n\nIn the wake of war, our leaders wear the mask of triumphant order. But beneath the exterior of assurances, many are uncertain. If the Confederation can be so disturbed, could it happen again? Even now, economies are slow to recover from conflict, and many systems lie in disarray after far-reaching battles. And while the war may be officially over, the hearts of men are so rarely stilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLENARRATIVE200;INTERNAL REPORT LOGGED AT 21:08:42 EARTH STANDARD TIME;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE200;Deep cover units Epsilon Cola and Charlie Mobile confirmed records of tightbeam communications between Confederate assets and previously unheard elements on Io. Cross-referencing with our documentation of federal units Io, we can say in high confidence that the message was aimed toward Confederate asset codenamed by their own intelligence as Whiskey Red. In summary he is a high-risk asset that can't be terminated on technical grounds, someone who was well connected enough to know about pre-crisis accounts and names, and simultaneously well connected enough that he must remain alive.\nWhiskey Red's existence confirms all our suspicions. He was there during the stock crash on Ganymede, where millions were left jobless after a 'mass computational fatal error'. He was also present during Operation Damocles, when unmarked special forces that disturbingly resembled Earth's own OTCD units stormed a rival corporate headquarters, making a follow-up supermerger that much easier. Naturally, he was in Frontier space during the seizure of orbital assets belonging to the planetary governor of Kalensis. And we know there are more like him, somewhere out there. The market crash wasn't intentional, no corporate entity wants to destroy their playing field, but men and women like Whiskey Red were given too much power and not one ounce of oversight.\nAs of this moment, our investigation is closed and pending further review.\n\n"The document you've just heard confirms that corporate entities worked alongside the Confederacy. Alongside the other documents in this leak this is damning evidence against many in high office. This is Angela Whittaker, speaking on behalf of the Sol News Network.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLENARRATIVE201;Political Fracturing in the Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE201;With the end of the Colonial War it has become clear that the Confederacy will not recover its former glory, at least any time soon. The Star Lanes are devastated, and an economic crisis has begun to unfold that is leaving billions jobless and hungry. The widespread economic devastation has led to the breakdown of the pre-war political order. This has caused the splintering of established political groupings, with what was once polite disputation rapidly boiling over into more and more violent clashes. This is most acute in local political parties, however more worryingly it has caused the formation of political cliques within government.\n\nMany now flock to these ever more fractious political cliques. The majority of these are little more than an open attempt at securing power for some vain sect; religious, corporate, political, or otherwise. Some however are far more dangerous. Increasingly, many within the bureaucracy and in the military chafe at the constitutionalism imposed by the Confederation.\n\nSome desire for the reestablishment of older systems, like Socialism, others however feel that we should experiment with new even more radical ideas such as abolitionism under one of their own. However, at present these radicals remain marginalised, with suggestions like these being attacked as the death of Free Democratic Values themselves. Yet, they are listened to.\n\nThis has contributed overall to making the situation far worse than it already is. As political opinion and allegiance begins to fracture it is becoming clearer that one group or another will have to emerge and re-establish stability. It is unclear who will win at this stage but all will soon have to choose where they stand, if they want to survive this new stage of the Crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANARRATIVE201;My Allegiance is to the Confederation, to Democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBNARRATIVE201;It is clear now that Democracy must be abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLENARRATIVE202;Economic Issues in the Confederacy: Hyperinflation & Hoarding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE202;CONFEDERATE STANDARD NEWS AT 10:00:00 EARTH STANDARD TIME\n\nAs the economy spirals out of control many have begun preparing for the worst. Confederate currency flirts with collapse and many mines, factories, and farms have begun hoarding resources in response as hyperinflation sets in. This is further coupled with attempts by a number of regions to try para-legal moves to autarky, with certain regions seeking to discourage outside trade and re-establish their economies as self-sufficient. This itself has led to further hoarding, and breakdowns in the Confederate economy.\n\nThis is most acute in outer regions where many people have simply started refusing to use Confederate currency altogether. This, coupled with the overall drops in demand, has severely hurt corporate bottom-lines, with most predicting catastrophic losses, along with unconfirmed reports of CEOs attempting to violate price fixing laws. Economists are at present divided on how to respond. Some have argued that all that is necessary from the government is a massive spending surge, to remove goods from the market. Others however blame the precarious economic arrangements of the Corporations. However, with the value of currency in free fall and inflation rampant it is increasingly unclear where pay for many people will come from, this itself has caused even further issues with hoarding.\n\nOverall the economic forecast is looking very bad indeed. This has been Angela Whittaker, speaking on behalf of the Sol News Network.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCNARRATIVE204;ZHAO JOHANSON, INTERNAL AFF. SUPERVISORY UNIT #9\n\nGrand Admiral, large sections in the military are in the final stages of planning a coup against the ineffectual Terran Government. The current economic crisis has spiraled out of control and so they have decided that the reins of power must be seized from the weak civilian state and discipline be whipped into the population. They have approached you to be the leader, making it clear that this will happen with or without you.\n\nThe plan, dubbed Operation Valkyrie, is straightforward, involving two stages. First, an uncooperative lieutenant will be assassinated using intelligence asset Alpha-9. Alpha-9 will then be captured by Military Police Officers who will find material in a prepared safehouse, Alpha-9 is using. This will link them back to the President. Using this, the Conspirators will seize control of the main media outlets, and further shutdown any outlet that cannot be controlled. After this the public execution of any further resisting officers will be broadcast, before dragging the President out of whatever hole they try to hide in and imprisoning them.\n\nRealistically, serious opposition is expected. However, the plan is already in motion, meaning it will go ahead with or without your approval. If you want to act it has to be now, after this the plan will be out of your hands, and you won't be able to help it or hinder it. Even if you stop it, you will be held responsible for allowing this to occur and may be imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLENARRATIVE209;The Terran Anarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE209;"The empire, long divided, must unite. Long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been." - Luo Guanzhong\n\nWeeks of negotiation have failed utterly, and the endless media speculation on the decline of the federal dollar have borne a poisoned fruit. Efforts to salvage worth out of the rapidly devaluing currency have failed utterly. Debts called to strengthen the dollar go outright ignored, with the navy plagued by desertion and unable to even try and enforce what was once a basic principle of membership in the Confederacy.\n\nStockpiles already dangerously low from the logistical nightmare of the Orion League War have emptied with no end in sight. Trade contracts and routes older than the Confederation itself have fallen silent as local systems begin to step in where the federal government has fallen lax. Meetings end with the same sentiment across most of Confederate space, and by the end of the week of negotiations Earth is delivered a terrible message. Once the bastion of civilization in the depths of space, The Confederation is effectively dissolved as her members break away to weather the storm of systemic economic collapse by themselves. The fleets across former Confederate space call for orders, for directions, but are given only silence in the wake of the sudden death of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANARRATIVE209;The central government has no control here anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
